  abstract = {Generalized polynomial chaos is known to fail for long-term integration, loosing its optimal convergence behavior and developing unacceptable error-levels. In this work, we present a time-dependent alternative of polynomial chaos in order to overcome these issues. This technique consists of an on-the-fly reinitialization of the polynomial chaos expansion at different discrete time-levels. At those time-levels, the new polynomial chaos expansion will be created in terms of the stochastic solution. This time-dependent approach is applied on a stochastic ordinary differential equation of which the results are compared with a standard generalized polynomial chaos solution.},

  abstract  = {机翼是民用客机最重要的气动部件,其性能直接影响飞机的经济性、环保性、安全性和舒适性。我国正在研制的大型民用客机想要在未来取得市场成功,必须在设计手段和设计思想上进行突破与创新。本文结合大型客机气动设计实践,发展了基于先进CFD方法的优化设计平台,提炼了气动设计思想,研究了关键流动现象,最终得出了工程适用的机翼、一体化与多段翼型设计方案。本论文提出了一种气动优化平台的搭建方法,认为寻求速度与精度、人工经验与数值优化、部件设计与整体设计、全局优化与局部寻优四个方面的矛盾统一是保证平台工程实用性的关键;发展了超临界压力分布形态约束的数字化定义和基于NURBS曲线的增量修型方法,实现了人工经验与自动优化的融合。本论文发展了高精度守恒重映方法,对优化平台的CFD工具NSAWET程序的窗口嵌入网格计算方法进行了改进,使非点对点搭接网格界面的流场信息传递更加精确,并应用多个标准算例对NSAWET程序进行了较为全面的验证。本论文较为系统地研究了三种超临界机翼压力分布形态的特性,认为对所设计类型飞机的机翼,若要同时保证良好巡航点和非设计点性能,必须使压力分布具有激波位置比超临界翼型稍微偏前的弱激波形态;应用RANS模拟结合遗传算法对大型民用客机进行了超临界机翼优化设计实践。结果表明多点优化是提高机翼方案实用性的有效方法。以巡航性能和阻力发散性能为目标的两点优化获得了工程实用性最优的设计方案。风洞试验结果与设计结果良好吻合。本论文完成了机翼/发动机一体化优化设计,研究了发动机安装位置和偏角对气动性能影响,并考虑了发动机影响进行机翼优化设计。研究发现,发动机短舱影响主要体现在减小了机翼中段的局部攻角。通过单点优化证明了无激波设计相对于弱激波设计减阻空间很小(约1count),且鲁棒性不可接受。通过两点优化得到了弱激波形态的实用机翼方案,进一步结合非设计点的人工修型,本工作得到最终设计方案。对比计算表明,设计方案的气动性能优于同类机型。本论文还研究了缝道参数和剖分形状对多段翼型性能的影响。分析了多段翼型升力曲线在失速攻角前出现非线性上扬的机理,认为缝道射流与后缘旋涡的竞争是导致升力线是否出现上扬的原因,并通过多点优化克服了这一问题。},

  abstract = {This paper introduces anew hybrid evolutionary algorithm (EA) for continuous global optimization problems, called estimation of distribution algorithm with local search (EDA/L). Like other EAs, EDA/L maintains and improves a population of solutions in the feasible region. Initial candidate solutions are generated by uniform design, these solutions evenly scatter over the feasible solution region. To generate a new population, a marginal histogram model is built based on the global statistical information extracted from the current population and then new solutions are sampled from the model thus built. The incomplete simplex method applies to every new solution generated by uniform design or sampled from the histogram model. Unconstrained optimization by diagonal quadratic approximation applies to several selected resultant solutions of the incomplete simplex method at each generation. We study the effectiveness of main components of EDA/L. The experimental results demonstrate that EDA/L is better than four other recent EAs in terms of the solution quality and the computational cost.},

  abstract = {GENERALLY, surface contamination of a wing leads to reductions in performance. Premature stall due to contamination can also have devastating effects on the controllability of aircraft. Currently, there is no established, effective method for monitoring aircraft performance and controllability in order to prevent stall under adverse conditions created by surface contamination. While angle-of-attack sensors are capable of providing an effective stall warning for an aircraft free of contaminants, the effectiveness of such systems greatly diminishes with the presence of contaminants on an aircraft wing. Gurbacki and Bragg [6] studied the steady and unsteady hinge moment behaviors of supercooled large-droplet ice-induced stall on a NACA 23012 airfoil model with a simple ﬂap. In that study, it was found that the rms of the unsteady hinge moment increased 1 to 3 degree angles of attack before stall for the iced case. Thus, it was identified that the unsteady separated flow led to unsteady changes in the hinge moment, giving rise to the concept that unsteady hinge moment measurements could be used to predict ice-induced stall [7]. Such a method could be further applied to a system capable of monitoring aircraft aerodynamic performance and providing real time predictions of the edge of a flight envelope. In addition to flight beyond the baseline-clean aircraft flight envelope, such a system could potentially detect a reduction in the envelope due to several in-flight environmental contaminants resulting from icing encounters, heavy rain, surface contamination in the form of roughness, and structural damage, such as bird strikes or battle damage. To further this concept, additional development is needed beyond the initial work of Gurbacki and Bragg [6]. ThisNote reports the further development of such a technique. The specific focus of this Note is the development of a detection algorithm using the unsteady hingemoment from a simple flap on an airfoil with and without contaminants. The algorithm developed is used to predict stall several degrees before the event.},

  abstract = {The cruise or loiter performance of an aircraft is intimately tied to its wing loading and its thrust-to-weight ratio. Paradoxically, mission performance is often not considered when these fundamental aircraft parameters are determined in conceptual design. In this paper, the traditional constraint diagramis extended to include contours of range or endurance parameter. These performance metrics represent the mission-performance capability of the aircraft without sizing the aircraft to a particular mission. This gives the designer an immediate and intuitive understanding of the tradeoff between the point andmission performance of the aircraft. The potential freedom for the designer to choose the operating condition of the aircraft is also considered. This improved constraint diagram presents the designer with a more complete basis for understanding and weighing the consequences of decisions. Through improved insight, the secondary impact of technologies can be better understood early in the design process.},

  abstract = {Aircraft conceptual design is traditionally carried out by manipulating low-fidelity analysis methods such as empirical equations or simplified physics. In an optimization framework, predicted optimum conceptual designs often lie directly on one or more of the specified constraint boundaries. Any discrepancies introduced by approximating the constraint values may result in designs that are found to fall short of performance targets when subjected to better analysis methods later in the design process. This research uses historical data to estimate the discrepancies associated with the simplified analysis methods commonly used in aircraft conceptual designs. A design optimization framework was developed that implements reliability-based design optimization methods to compensate for the discrepancies associated with the approximate analysis methods. This yields optimized aircraft conceptual designs that are less likely to fail to meet any specified performance requirements when reevaluated using high-fidelity methods later in the design process.},

  abstract = {The use of gradient-based optimization algorithms in inverse design is well established as a practical approach to aerodynamic design. A typical procedure uses a simulation scheme to evaluate the objective function (from the approximate states) and its gradient, then passes this information to an optimization algorithm. Once the simulation scheme (CFD flow solver) has been selected and used to provide approximate function evaluations, there are several possible approaches to the problem of computing gradients. One popular method is to differentiate the simulation scheme and compute design sensitivities that are then used to obtain gradients. Although this black-box approach has many advantages in shape optimization problems, one must compute mesh sensitivities in order to compute the design sensitivity. In this paper, we present an alternative approach using the PDE sensitivity equation to develop algorithms for computing gradients. This approach has the advantage that mesh sensitivities need not be computed. Moreover, when it is possible to use the CFD scheme for both the forward problem and the sensitivity equation, then there are computational advantages. An apparent disadvantage of this approach is that it does not always produce consistent derivatives. However, for a proper combination of discretization schemes, one can showasymptotic consistencyunder mesh refinement, which is often sufficient to guarantee convergence of the optimal design algorithm. In particular, we show that when asymptotically consistent schemes are combined with a trust-region optimization algorithm, the resulting optimal design method converges. We denote this approach as thesensitivity equation method.The sensitivity equation method is presented, convergence results are given, and the approach is illustrated on two optimal design problems involving shocks.},

  abstract = {This paper considers a transportation problem for moving empty or laden containers for a logistic company. Owing to the limited resource of its vehicles (trucks and trailers), the company often needs to sub-contract certain job orders to outsourced companies. A model for this truck and trailer vehicle routing problem (TTVRP) is first constructed in the paper. The solution to the TTVRP consists of finding a complete routing schedule for serving the jobs with minimum routing distance and number of trucks, subject to a number of constraints such as time windows and availability of trailers. To solve such a multi-objective and multi-modal combinatorial optimization problem, a hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (HMOEA) featured with specialized genetic operators, variable-length representation and local search heuristic is applied to find the Pareto optimal routing solutions for the TTVRP. Detailed analysis is performed to extract useful decision-making information from the multi-objective optimization results as well as to examine the correlations among different variables, such as the number of trucks and trailers, the trailer exchange points, and the utilization of trucks in the routing solutions. It has been shown that the HMOEA is effective in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems, such as finding useful trade-off solutions for the TTVRP routing problem.},

In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (we called it the Non-dominated Sorting GA-II or NSGA-II) which alleviates all the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O ( MN 2 ) computational complexity is presented. Second, a selection operator is presented which creates a mating pool by combining the parent and child populations and selecting the best (with respect to fitness and spread) N solutions. Simulation results on five difficult test problems show that the proposed NSGA-II, in most problems, is able to find much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to PAES and SPEA—two other elitist multi-objective EAs which pay special attention towards creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Because of NSGA-II’s low computational requirements, elitist approach, and parameter-less sharing approach, NSGA-II should find increasing applications in the years to come.},

The main GA performs global search while the MGA explores a neighborhood of the current solution provided by the main GA, looking for better solutions. The MGA operator performs genetic local search. The major advantage of MGA is its ability to identify and follow narrow ridges of arbitrary direction leading to the global optimum. The proposed GA-MGA scheme is tested against 13 different schemes, including a simple GA and GAs with different hill-climbing operators. Experiments are conducted on a test set including eight constrained optimization problems with continuous variables. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed GA-MGA scheme. For the same number of fitness evaluations, GA-MGA exhibited a significantly better performance in terms of solution accuracy, feasibility percentage of the attained solutions, and robustness},

By introducing a quasi-three-dimensional through-flow design code and a design code of axial compressor airfoils with camber lines of arbitrary shape, and involving a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics solver, this paper establishes a numerical aerodynamic optimization platform for the three-dimensional blades of axial compressors. The optimization in this paper mainly has four features. First, it applies the conventional inverse design method instead of the common computer aided geometric design parametrization method to generate a three-dimensional blade. Second, it chooses aerodynamic parameters with physical meaning as design variables instead of purely geometrical parameters. Third, it presents a stage-by-stage optimization strategy about the multistage turbomachinery optimization. Fourth, it introduces the visual analysis method into optimization, which can adjust variation ranges of variables by analyzing how great the variables influence the objective function. The above techniques were applied to the redesign of a single rotor row and two double-stage axial fans. The departure angles and work distributions in the inverse design were taken as design variables separately in optimizations of the single rotor and double-stage fans, and they were parametrically represented by means of Bezier curves, whose parameters were used as the optimization variables in the practical operation. The three investigated examples elucidate that not only the techniques mentioned above are appropriate and effective in engineering, but also the design guidance for similar inverse design problems can be obtained from the optimization results.},

We use three forms of elitism and a memory to generate the initial population of the micro-GA. Our approach is tested with several standard functions found in the specialized literature.

  abstract = {Abstract There exist quantum algorithms that are more efﬁcient than their clas- sical counterparts; such algorithms were invented by Shor in 1994 and then Grover in 1996. A lack of invention since Grover’s algorithm has been commonly attributed to the non-intuitive nature of quantum algorithms to the classically trained person. Thus, the idea of using computers to automatically generate quantum algorithms based on an evolutionary model emerged. A limitation of this approach is that quantum computers do not yet exist and quantum simulation on a classical machine has an exponential order overhead. Nevertheless, early research into evolving quantum algorithms has shown promise. This paper provides an introduction into quantum and evolutionary algorithms for the computer scientist not familiar with these ﬁelds. The exciting ﬁeld of using evolutionary algorithms to evolve quantum algorithms is then reviewed.},

The heights of Gurney flaps range from 0.25 to 3% airfoil chord lengths.The incompressible/compressibleNavier–Stokes equations were used to simulate the flow structure around the airfoils in subsonic/transonic flows, respectively, with the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model. In comparison with the clean airfoil, the Gurney flap can significantly increase the prestall lift and lift-to-drag ratio of an RAE-2822 airfoil at a small angle of attack. Nosedown pitching moment also increased with the Gurney flap height. At both takeoff-and-landing status and cruise phase, the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil was significantly improved byGurney flaps with the height below 1%airfoil chord length. In addition, the surface pressure distribution, wake low velocity profile, and trailing-edge flow structure of the airfoil were illustrated, which helps to understand the mechanisms of the Gurney flap to improve RAE-2822 airfoil aerodynamic performance.},

However, this typically results in the need for a significant number of simulations at a variety of design conditions to calculate the objective function. The following paper attempts to address this problem through the application of a multilevel cokriging model within the optimization process. A large number of single-point design simulations are augmented by a smaller number of multipoint simulations. The technique is shown to result in surrogate models as effective as those produced using a traditional multipoint process when optimizing a transonic airfoil but with a reduction in the total number of simulations.},

This includes a detailed discussion on how to account for design uncertainties and how to measure robustness (i.e., how to evaluate robustness). The main focus will be on the different approaches to perform robust optimization in practice including the methods of mathematical programming, deterministic nonlinear optimization, and direct search methods such as stochastic approximation and evolutionary computation. It discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the different methods, thus, providing a basis for guiding the engineer to the most appropriate techniques.

  abstract = {The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows is an important combinatorial optimization problem consisting in the determination of the set of routes of minimum distance to deliver goods, using a fleet of identical vehicles with restricted capacity, so that vehicles must visit customers within a time frame. A large number of algorithms have been proposed to solve single-objective formulations of this problem, including meta-heuristic approaches, which provide high quality solutions in reasonable runtimes. Nevertheless, in recent years some authors have analyzed multi-objective variants that consider additional objectives to the distance travelled. This paper considers not only the minimum distance required to deliver goods, but also the workload imbalance in terms of the distances travelled by the used vehicles and their loads. Thus, MMOEASA, a Pareto-based hybrid algorithm that combines evolutionary computation and simulated annealing, is here proposed and analyzed for solving these multi-objective formulations of the VRPTW. The results obtained when solving a subset of Solomon’s benchmark problems show the good performance of this hybrid approach.},

  abstract  = {This chapter proposes a combination of estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and the 2-opt local search algorithm (EDA/LS) for the quadratic assignment problem (QAP). In EDA/LS, a new operator, called guided mutation, is employed for generating new solutions. This operator uses both global statistical information collected from the previous search and the location information of solutions found so far. The 2-opt local search algorithm is applied to each new solution generated by guided mutation. A restart strategy based on sta-tistical information is used when the search is trapped in a local area. Experimental results on a set of QAP test instances show that EDA/LS is comparable with the memetic algorithm of Merz and Freisleben and outperforms estimation of distribution algorithm with guided local search (EDA/GLS). The proximate optimality principle on the QAP is veriﬁed experimentally to justify the rationale behind heuristics (including EDA/GLS) for the QAP.},

  abstract = {With the speed upgrade of the high-speed train, the aerodynamic drag becomes one of the key factors to restrain the train speed  and energy saving. In order to reduce the aerodynamic drag of train head, a new parametric approach called local shape func- tion (LSF) was adopted based on the free form surface deformation (FFD) method and a new efficient optimization method  based on the response surface method (RSM) of GA-GRNN. The optimization results show that the parametric method can  control the large deformation with a few design parameters, and can ensure the deformation zones smoothness and smooth  transition of different deformation regions. With the same sample points for training, GA-GRNN performs better than GRNN  to get the global optimal solution. As an example, the aerodynamic drag for a simplified shape with head + one carriage + tail  train is reduced by 8.7%. The proposed optimization method is efficient for the engineering design of high-speed train. },

In this approach, the displacement of the geometry modification is controlled via the nonuniform rational B-spline represented displacement map. In the case of the deformation including a junction, additional juncture treatment on the unstructured computational fluid dynamics mesh is applied following the geometry modification by the displacement map. Coupling the shape representation tool with a discrete unstructured Euler adjoint system, aerodynamic optimization of engine-airframe integration and tail fuselage integration designs are conducted as design examples. Through the design studies, it is demonstrated that the proposed geometrical representation approach can be applied to a wide variety of complex aircraft configurations, avoiding ad hoc preparation of the geometric representation tools.},

@article{Wickenheiser2011,
  abstract = {THE preliminary design of morphing aircraft [1–7] requires aerodynamic analyses at widely varying flight conditions and geometric configurations. Thus, a fast, adaptable algorithm is required that can accept geometric “morphing” parameter variations and recompute the wing (or aircraft) aerodynamic  characteristics. Lifting-line theory, first developed by Prandtl and Tietjins [8] and Munk [9], is chosen because it fulfills these needs and is readily programmed to populate large, multidimensional lookup tables for reconfigurable aircraft simulation [7]. The basis of the lifting-line technique used in the present study is Weissinger’s method for straight, swept wings [10]. This method uses a flow-tangency (i.e.,impermeability) condition at the three-quarter-chord curve of the wing, which avoids the singularity Prandtl's method introduces for swept wings when the effects of bound vorticity are incorporated. Prandtl's and, indeed, Weissinger's methods assume that the airfoil section lift curves are linear (that is, the lift coefficient at any angle of attack is fully described by the zero-lift angle of attack and the lift-curve slope) and that the section drag coefficients are identically zero, i.e., that the flow is inviscid. A common method to incorporate nonlinear sectional data is to iterate on the lifting-line formulation via a weighted averaging technique that blends the linearized potential flow over the wing with the nonlinear sectional data. This iterative procedure originates with the work of Tani [11] and Multhopp [12], who have developed a numerical integration technique similar to Gaussian quadrature for computing the net lift contribution of the spanwise circulation distribution using sine series. The coefficients of these series have been formalized and tabulated by Sivells and Neely [13]. More recently, this method has been used to calculate the aerodynamic characteristics of drooped leading-edge wings around stall [14]. It should be noted that the above studies have been restricted to straight wings so that Prandtl's formulation can be used. Owens [15] has applied this iterative technique to Weissinger’s method for straight, swept wings. Several extensions/generalizations to Weissinger's method have been developed subsequently. Wing quarter-chord curves described by polynomial equations have been analyzed using modiﬁed lifting-line theory for stationary [16] and oscillating wings [17]. Wickenheiser and Garcia [18] have generalized this formulation to wings of arbitrary, piecewise continuous curvature. Phillips and Snyder [19] have developed a technique using 3-D vortex elements that uses  Newton's method to solve the resulting system of nonlinear equations. The present study is based on modifications to the authors' previous work on curved lifting lines [18]. First, a summary of the salient features of the generalized Weissinger's method is given, followed by a presentation of the modifications to this method necessary to incorporate nonlinear section data. An iterative procedure is developed whose purpose is to cause the convergence of the results of theWeissinger's method and the results using the sectional aerodynamic data. Subsequently, the results of this technique are compared with wind-tunnel data for elliptical and crescent wings at a Reynolds number Re=1.7e6 [20] and tapered wings at Re=3.49e6 [13].},

Both the hybrid NM-GA and NM-PSO algorithms incorporate concepts from the NM, GA or PSO, which are readily to implement in practice and the computation of functional derivatives is not necessary. The hybrid methods were first illustrated through four test functions from the RSM literature and were compared with original NM, GA and PSO algorithms. In each test scheme, the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of these methods were evaluated via associated performance statistics, and the proposed hybrid approaches prove to be very suitable for solving the optimization problems of RSM-type. The hybrid methods were then tested by ten difficult nonlinear continuous functions and were compared with the best known heuristics in the literature. The results show that both hybrid algorithms were able to reach the global optimum in all runs within a comparably computational expense. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {AIRCRAFT parameter estimation [1–3] is probably the most outstanding and illustrated example of the system identification methodology. An extensive investigation in the field of unsteady aerodynamics associated with aerodynamic stall at high angles of attack using computational fluid dynamic methods,wind-tunnel tests and semi-empirical methods is going on in the recent times [3–6]. Such models are used to investigate complex flow phenomena analytically, but presenting them in an analytical form suitable for parameter estimation is a difficult task. An alternative approach analytically describes [3] the flow separation including stall hysteresis as a function of an internal state variable. This approach retains the state-space formulation for explicit identification and validation from flight data. Greenwell [5] provides a review of unsteady aerodynamic modeling. The application of the same to the flight data has been presented in [6]. The application of the output error method and its variants [3] for parameter estimation using ﬂight data of the air vehicle requires postulation of correct ﬂight dynamic formulations having an accurate description of aerodynamic model. Since aerodynamicmodel at high angles of attack near stall may not be exact, the solution of equations of motion using not so exact aerodynamic model may lead to inaccurate computation of motion variables (modeling error). Generally, most of the estimation methods face difﬁculties in estimating aerodynamic parameters from ﬂight data having modeling error (process noise). More recently, investigations have been carried out to explore the potential of artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) [7,8] for aircraft aerodynamic modeling and parameter estimation. A feedforward neural network (FFNN) is found to be themost promising for its application to aircraftmodeling. The main advantage and strength of FFNN[7,8] modeling is its ability to capture highly nonlinear complex phenomena for which the model postulation with physical understanding is difﬁcult. This capability of a FFNN to model highly nonlinear complex phenomena and handle the process noise [3] in a better way has been used to estimate the aerodynamic parameters from ﬂight data at high angles of attack. It has also been shown [3] during the modeling of lift, drag, and pitching moment coefﬁcients of the research aircraft HFB-320 that the predictive capability of the trained FFNN for ﬂight data with atmospheric turbulence is found to be good. Neural Gauss–Newton (NGN) method, proposed by Peyada and Ghosh [8], is an algorithm that uses FFNN and the Gauss–Newton optimization method to estimate aerodynamic parameters fromﬂight data. The NGN method does not require solving of equations of motion. The functional relationship between the input and output variables is mapped implicitly using FFNN. Because of non-availability of the aerodynamicmodel near stall, it was decided to use NGN method to capture aerodynamic model using ﬂight data near stall. The ﬂight data (near stall) were generated using in-house research aircraft Hansa-3. Both the Maximum Likelihood (ML) and the NGN methods have been used for this study. This Technical Note evaluates the suitability/adequacy of the nonlinear aerodynamic model for stall aerodynamics [3] for the purpose of extraction of aerodynamic parameters. The study showed that the NGN method can advantageously be applied on ﬂight data to capture nonlinear aerodynamics (near stall).},

  abstract = {The flapping wing of a micro air vehicle is optimized to enhance performance while some rigidity is kept with a specific mass. A work flow for the design of the flapping wing is defined. The performances to be enhanced are thrust coefficient and propulsive efficiency. The flapping kinematics of the flapping wing is determined by solving a path optimization problem that maximizes the performances. The optimization process is carried out based on a well-defined surrogate model. The surrogate model is made from the results of two-dimensional fluid dynamic analysis. The kriging method is employed to establish the surrogate model and a genetic algorithm is used for the multi. objective function problem. Dynamic topology optimization is performed to find the distribution of reinforcement. Certain rigidity can be kept by the results of topology optimization. A dynamic topology optimization method is developed by modification of the equivalent static loads method for nonlinear static response structural optimization. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic analysis is performed based on the optimum values of the path optimization to evaluate the external loads for the topology optimization process. The process of the defined work flow is materialized by interfacing various software systems.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms often have to solve optimization problems in the presence of a wide range of uncertainties. Generally, uncertainties in evolutionary computation can be divided into the following four categories. First, the fitness function is noisy. Second, the design variables and/or the environmental parameters may change after optimization, and the quality of the obtained optimal solution should be robust against environmental changes or deviations from the optimal point. Third, the fitness function is approximated, which means that the fitness function suffers from approximation errors. Fourth, the optimum of the problem to be solved changes over time and, thus, the optimizer should be able to track the optimum continuously. In all these cases, additional measures must be taken so that evolutionary algorithms are still able to work satisfactorily. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of the related work within a unified framework, which has been scattered in a variety of research areas. Existing approaches to addressing different uncertainties are presented and discussed, and the relationship between the different categories of uncertainties are investigated. Finally, topics for future research are suggested.},

The methods are divided into three major categories: methods with a priori articulation of preferences, methods with a posteriori articulation of preferences, and methods with no articulation of preferences. Genetic algorithms are surveyed as well. Commentary is provided on three fronts, concerning the advantages and pitfalls of individual methods, the different classes of methods, and the field of MOO as a whole. The Characteristics of the most significant methods are summarized. Conclusions are drawn that reflect often-neglected ideas and applicability to engineering problems. It is found that no single approach is superior. Rather, the selection of a specific method depends on the type of information that is provided in the problem, the user's preferences, the solution requirements, and the availability of software.},

  abstract = {Shape optimization with a multiobjective optimization technique and tradeoff analysis of the three-dimensional wings-in-ground effect have been performed. Unlike an airplane out-of-ground effect, a wing-in-ground vehicle has to satisfy static height stability in order to cruise steadily in ground effect. However, it is difﬁcult to simultaneously satisfy both high aerodynamic performance and static height stability because of the strong tradeoffs between the two. A multiobjective optimization technique can address this problem. In multiobjective optimization, the optimum is not unique; rather, it is a set of nondominated potential solutions called Pareto optima. In this study, after 19 evolutions of a genetic algorithm, 74 nondominated Pareto optima are obtained and four different groups can be observed from the Pareto optima.Each group represents a set of the potential global solutions for a single objective or combined objectives. The analysis of the Pareto optima suggests that the lift is increased because of increased pressure on the lower wing surface, but the inﬂuence of pressure on the upper surface is not signiﬁcant. The wing thickness and curvature increase the lift further, but they are not favorable for static height stability and the lift–drag ratio; a swept-forward wing can improve the static height stability.},

  abstract = {We discuss the arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC), which has been subject of research in a few recent theoretical papers. Like all polynomial chaos expansion techniques, aPC approximates the dependence of simulation model output on model parameters by expansion in an orthogonal polynomial basis. The aPC generalizes chaos expansion techniques towards arbitrary distributions with arbitrary probability measures, which can be either discrete, continuous, or discretized continuous and can be specified either analytically (as probability density/cumulative distribution functions), numerically as histogram or as raw data sets. We show that the aPC at finite expansion order only demands the existence of a finite number of moments and does not require the complete knowledge or even existence of a probability density function. This avoids the necessity to assign parametric probability distributions that are not sufficiently supported by limited available data. Alternatively, it allows modellers to choose freely of technical constraints the shapes of their statistical assumptions. Our key idea is to align the complexity level and order of analysis with the reliability and detail level of statistical information on the input parameters. We provide conditions for existence and clarify the relation of the aPC to statistical moments of model parameters. We test the performance of the aPC with diverse statistical distributions and with raw data. In these exemplary test cases, we illustrate the convergence with increasing expansion order and, for the first time, with increasing reliability level of statistical input information. Our results indicate that the aPC shows an exponential convergence rate and converges faster than classical polynomial chaos expansion techniques. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract  = {This article attempts a unification of the two approaches that have dominated theoretical climate dynamics since its inception in the 1960s: the nonlinear deterministic and the linear stochastic one. This unification, via the theory of random dynamical systems (RDS), allows one to consider the detailed geometric structure of the random attractors associated with nonlinear, stochastically perturbed systems. We report on high-resolution numerical studies of two idealized models of fundamental interest for climate dynamics. The first of the two is a stochastically forced version of the classical Lorenz model. The second one is a low-dimensional, nonlinear stochastic model of the El NioSouthern Oscillation (ENSO). These studies provide a good approximation of the two models' global random attractors, as well as of the time-dependent invariant measures supported by these attractors; the latter are shown to have an intuitive physical interpretation as random versions of SinaRuelleBowen (SRB) measures. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The plate is subjected to harmonic planar acoustic waves at grazing incidence in the presence of a subsonic uniform mean flow in the duct. Both clamped and simply supported plates are considered. Regimes are identified in which the structural-acoustic coupling plays a significant role on the response of the plate. Four metrics characterizing the coupled response are considered: the deviation of the peak response frequency from the in vacuo natural frequency of plate, the amplitude of the peak response, the effective acoustic damping of the plate, and the plate intermodal coupling through the duct acoustic field. For a typical aerospace structure, the plate-fluid coupling does little to change the fundamental vibration frequencies from their in vacuo values but significantly alters the amplitudes of the plate vibration.

Part I of the paper presents a review of stochastic processes and spectral estimation (with some new results) and a tutorial on simulating continuous noise processes with a known autospectral density or autocorrelation function. In defining these techniques for computer generating sequences, it also defines the necessary accuracy criteria. These methods are compared to some of the common techniques for noise generation and the problems, or advantages, of each are discussed. Finally, Part I presents results on simulating stochastic differential equations. A Runge-Kutta (RK) method is presented for numerically solving these equations. Part II of the paper discusses power law, or 1/fα, noises. Such noise processes occur frequently in nature and, in many cases, with nonintegral values for α. A review of 1/f noises in devices and systems is followed by a discussion of the most common continuous 1/f noise models. The paper then presents a new digital model for power law noises. This model allows for very accurate and efficient computer generation of 1/fα noises for any α. Many of the statistical properties of this model are discussed and compared to the previous continuous models. Lastly, a number of approximate techniques for generating power law noises are presented for rapid or real time simulation},

The one-dimensional gust and gust gradient spectral models, which form the basis for the simulation scheme, are developed from three-dimensional, von Karman spectra, integrated over finite limits based on the characteristic dimensions (length, width, and thickness) of the flight vehicle. By means of the simulation process nondimensional time series for both gusts and gust gradients have been generated and stored on a series of magnetic tapes for four altitude bands ranging from 0 to 10,000 meters. These Shuttle Simulated Turbulence Tapes (SSTT) have been validated by means of spectral and statistical analyses with satisfactory results. The dimensionless form of the time series coupled with the use of a von Karman spectral model (as opposed to a Dryden model) distinguish the SSTT from earlier turbulence simulation concepts.},

The wing structure is modeled theoretically using von Karman plate theory that accounts for geometric strain-displacement nonlinearities in the plate wing structure. A component modal analysis is used to derive the full structural equations of motion for the wing/store system. A 3-D time domain vortex lattice aerodynamic model including a reduced order model aerodynamic technique and a slender body aerodynamic theory for the store are also used to investigate the nonlinear aeroelastic system. The effects of the freeplay gap, the gust angle of attack and the initial conditions on the gust response are discussed. The quantitative correlations between the theory and experiment are reasonably good, but in the range of the dominant resonant frequency of this nonlinear system, i.e. at larger response amplitudes, the correlations are not good. The theoretical structural model needs to be improved to determine larger amplitude motions near the resonant frequency. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Two cases are considered, without and with gust excitation.

  abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based simulations, along with parametric and nonparametric reduced-order models for gust responses are presented. A CFD code is enhanced to simulate responses of an airfoil to arbitrary-shaped gust inputs. Time-domain autoregressive-moving-average models are identified based on CFD responses to random gust excitations, using system-identification methods. Responses to discrete gusts of various shapes, amplitudes, and gradient lengths are computed via the reduced-order models and compared to responses simulated directly by the CFD code. The reduced-order models predict the lift and pitching moment histories accurately throughout the subsonic and transonic regimes. They offer significant savings in computational resources compared to the full CFD simulation, because only one CFD run is required for reduced-order model identification, from which responses to arbitrary-shaped gusts can be rapidly estimated. The combination of reduced-order models and full CFD simulation offers a computationally efficient tool set of various-fidelity time-domain models for gust responses. The reduced-order model can be used for rapid tuned-gust analyses, and the critical cases can be simulated with a full CFD run, providing pressure distribution for airframe structural design.},

  abstract = {This textbook is aimed at newcomers to nonlinear dynamics and chaos, especially students taking a first course in the subject. The presentation stresses analytical methods, concrete examples and geometric intuition. The theory is developed systematically, starting with first-order differential equations and their bifurcations, followed by phase plane analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations, and culminating with the Lorenz equations, chaos, iterated maps, period doubling, renormalization, fractals, and strange attractors.A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on applications. These include mechanical vibrations, lasers, biological rhythms, superconducting circuits, insect outbreaks, chemical oscillators, genetic control systems, chaotic waterwheels, and even a technique for using chaos to send secret messages. In each case, the scientific background is explained at an elementary level and closely integrated with the mathematical theory.Richly illustrated, and with many exercises and worked examples, this book is ideal for an introductory course at the junior/senior or first-year graduate level. It is also ideal for the scientist who has not had formal instruction in nonlinear dynamics, but who now desires to begin informal study. The prerequisites are multivariable calculus and introductory physics.},

These are important features in common with vastly more complex problems involving climate modeling or molecular biological systems. This model is a suitable approximation of the Burgers-Hopf equation involving Galerkin projection on Fourier modes. The model has a detailed mathematical structure that leads to a well-defined equilibrium statistical theory as well as a simple scaling theory for correlations. The numerical evidence presented here strongly supports the behavior predicted from these statistical theories. Unlike the celebrated dissipative and dispersive approximations of the Burgers-Hopf equation, which exhibit exactly solvable and/or completely integrable behavior, these model approximations have strong intrinsic chaos with ergodic behavior.},

  abstract = {A numerical method is demonstrated for solving the steady and unsteady Euler equations on stationary Cartersian grids for the purpose of time-domain simulation of aeroelastic problems. Wall boundary conditions are implemented on nonmoving mean chord positions by assuming the airfoil being thin and undergoing small deformation, whereas the full nonlinear Euler equations are used in the flowfield for accurate resolution of shock waves and vorticity. The method does not require the generation of moving body-fitted grids and thus can be easily deployed in any fluid-structure interaction problem involving relatively small deformation of a thin body. The first-order wall boundary conditions are used in solving the full Euler equations, and the results are compared with the Euler solutions using the exact boundary conditions and known experimental data. It is shown that the first-order boundary conditions are adequate to represent airfoils of typical thicknesses with small deformation for both steady and unsteady calculations. Flutter boundaries are accurately predicted by this method for the Isogai wing model test case.},

The IB formulation of such problems, derived here from the principle of least ac- tion, involves both Eulerian and Lagrangian variables, linked by the Dirac delta function. Spatial discretization of the IB equations is based on a fixed Cartesian mesh for the Eulerian variables, and a moving curvilinear mesh for the Lagrangian variables. The two types of variables are linked by interaction equations that involve a smoothed approximation to the Dirac delta function. Eulerian/Lagrangian identities govern the transfer of data from one mesh to the other. Temporal discretization is by a second-order Runge–Kutta method. Current and future research directions are pointed out, and applications of the IB method are briefly discussed.},

@article{Mittal2005,
  abstract = {The term immersed boundary methodwas first used in reference to a method de- veloped by Peskin (1972) to simulate cardiac mechanics and associated blood flow. The distinguishing feature of this methodwas that the entire simulationwas carried out on a Cartesian grid, which did not conform to the geometry of the heart, and a novel procedurewas formulated for imposing the effect of the immersed boundary (IB) on the flow. Since Peskin introduced this method, numerous modifications and refinements have been proposed and a number of variants of this approach nowex- ist. In addition, there is another class of methods, usually referred to as Cartesian grid methods, which were originally developed for simulating inviscid flows with complex embedded solid boundaries on Cartesian grids (Berger&Aftosmis 1998, Clarke et al. 1986, Zeeuw & Powell 1991). These methods have been extended to simulate unsteady viscous flows (Udaykumar et al. 1996, Ye et al. 1999) and thus have capabilities similar to those of IB methods. In this review, we use the term im- mersed boundary (IB) method to encompass all such methods that simulate viscous flows with immersed (or embedded) boundaries on grids that do not conform to the shape of these boundaries. Furthermore, this review focuses mainly on IB meth- ods for flows with immersed solid boundaries. Application of these and related methods to problems with liquid-liquid and liquid-gas boundaries was covered in previous reviews by Anderson et al. (1998) and Scardovelli & Zaleski (1999). Consider the simulation of flow past a solid body shown in Figure 1a. The conventional approach to this would employ structured or unstructured grids that conform to the body. Generating these grids proceeds in two sequential steps. First, a surface grid covering the boundaries b is generated. This is then used as a boundary condition to generate a grid in the volumef occupied by the fluid. If a finite-difference method is employed on a structured grid, then the differential form of the governing equations is transformed to a curvilinear coordinate system aligned with the grid lines (Ferziger & Peric 1996). Because the grid conforms to the surface of the body, the transformed equations can then be discretized in the 0066-4189/05/0115-0239$14.00 239 Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 2005.37:239-261.

A nonlinear equation of motion of the plate based on the inextensibility assumption, coupled with an unsteady lumped vortex model for the aerodynamic part is used to analyze the instability and post-critical dynamical behaviour of this fluidstructure system theoretically. Experiments have been conducted in a 3 ft×2 ft (914 mm×610 mm) cross-section wind tunnel, using polypropylene carbonate (PPC) films, thin brass plates, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheets, and type 304 stainless steel sheets, with maximum dimensions 224 mm×168 mm. In the experiments, time traces, power spectral densities (PSDs), phase-plane plots, Poincaré maps, probability density functions (PDFs) and autocorrelations are used to characterize the motions of the system. Periodic and chaotic oscillations have been observed in the experiments. It has also been observed that flutter arises via a subcritical bifurcation involving hysteresis for large aspect ratio plates; this hysteresis does not occur for low aspect ratio plates. The hysteresis phenomenon is considered to be due to spanwise deformation of the plates. The effect of aspect ratio on critical flow velocity is investigated. The experimental critical flow velocities for flutter onset are in good agreement with the theoretically predicted values. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A panel forced by a supersonic unsteady flow is numerically investigated using a finite difference method, a Galerkin approach, and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). The aeroelastic model investigated is based on piston theory for modeling the flow-induced forces, and von Karman plate theory for modeling the panel. Structural non-linearity is considered, and it is due to the non-linear coupling between bending and stretching. Several novel facets of behavior are explored, and key aspects of using a Galerkin method for modeling the dynamics of the panel exhibiting limit cycle oscillations and chaos are investigated. It is shown that multiple limit cycles may co-exist, and they are both symmetric and asymmetric. Furthermore, the level of spatial coherence in the dynamics is estimated by means of POD. Reduced order models for the dynamics are constructed. The sensitivity to initial conditions of the non-linear aeroelastic system in the chaotic regime limits the capability of the reduced order models to identically model the time histories of the system. However, various global characteristics of the dynamics, such as the main attractor governing the dynamics, are accurately predicted by the reduced order models. For the case of limit cycle oscillations and stable buckling, the reduced order models are shown to be accurate and robust to parameter variations. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The reduction of energy consumption in buildings is of central importance in the North America’s and European Union’s energy policy. Following the adoption of legislative measures, methodologies are developed and employed to calculate the year- round energy performance of buildings. A number of computational tools are already available, however, the specific procedures of incorporating their use in the building shell and HVAC system’s design process are not yet agreed. Energy performance standards for new buildings and large existing buildings subject to major renovation, are set at national level, but the process of translating these standards to shell and HVAC system sizing and design is not yet clear. This paper demonstrates the application of TRNSYS building energy simulation to produce design optimization directions for a new Department building under study contract. Sensitivity runs are employed to assess the effect of certain design parameters on the transient building’s energy performance. The simulation process is demonstrated for two different levels of detail, with the higher level involving detailed simulation of the main HVAC equipment. The results of energy simulation runs are presented in the form of designer friendly diagrams, with special emphasis on the transient performance during critical periods of the year. The role of building shell insulation and design, HVAC system size, (heating and cooling), ventilation strategy, equipment performance characteristics and climatic conditions is studied. Based on the results, a methodology can be assembled for the incorporation of building energy simulation on the building shell and HVAC design process. Reasonable criteria for the degree of modeling complexity to be implemented, based on the available manpower, computing and other resources are discussed.},

  abstract = {Computational methods for sensitivity analysis are invaluable tools for aerodynamics research and engineering design. However, traditional sensitivity analysis methods break down when applied to long-time averaged quantities in turbulent fluid flow fields, specifically those obtained using high-fidelity turbulence simulations. This is because of a number of dynamical properties of turbulent and chaotic fluid flows, most importantly high sensitivity of the initial value problem, popularly known as the "butterfly effect". The recently developed least squares shadowing (LSS) method avoids the issues encountered by traditional sensitivity analysis methods by approximating the "shadow trajectory" in phase space, avoiding the high sensitivity of the initial value problem. The following paper discusses how the least squares problem associated with LSS is solved. Two methods are presented and are demonstrated on a simulation of homogeneous isotropic turbulence and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation, a 4th order chaotic partial differential equation. We find that while LSS computes fairly accurate gradients, faster, more efficient linear solvers are needed to apply both LSS methods presented in this paper to larger simulations.},

  abstract = {The fluctuation–dissipation theorem (FDT) has been suggested as a method of calculating the response of the climate system to a small change in an external parameter. The simplest form of the FDT assumes that the probability density function of the unforced system is Gaussian and most applications of the FDT have made a quasi-Gaussian assumption. However, whether or not the climate system is close to Gaussian remains open to debate, and non-Gaussianity may limit the usefulness of predictions of quasi-Gaussian forms of the FDT. Here we describe an implementation of the full non-Gaussian form of the FDT. The principle of the quasi-Gaussian FDT is retained in that the response to forcing is predicted using only information available from observations of the unforced system, but in the non-Gaussian case this information must be used to estimate aspects of the probability density function of the unforced system. Since this estimate is implemented using the methods of nonparametric statistics, the new form is referred to herein as a “nonparametric FDT.” Application is demonstrated to a sequence of simple models including a stochastic version of the three-component Lorenz model. The authors show that the nonparametric FDT gives accurate predictions in cases where the quasi-Gaussian FDT fails. Practical application of the nonparametric FDT may require optimization of the method set out here for higher-dimensional systems.},

The other configuration, designated HP03, was designed for long-duration flight. The plan was to use the solar cells to power the vehicle’s electric motors and subsystems during the day and to use a modified commercial hydrogen–air fuel cell system for use during the night. The vehicle was also equipped with batteries as a backup source of power.

The system response is determined by time marching of the governing equations using a standard Runge-Kutta algorithm in conjunction with Hénon’s method for integrating a system of equations to a prescribed surface of phase space section. Hénon’s method is used to locate the ‘‘switching points’’ accurately and efficiently as the system moves from one linear region into another. An experimental model which closely approximates the three degree-of-freedom typical section in two-dimensional, incompressible flow has been created to validate the theoretical model. Consideration is given to modeling realistically the structural damping present in the experimental system. The effect of the freeplay on the system response is examined numerically and experimentally. The development of the state-space model offers a low-order, computationally efficient means of modeling fully the freeplay nonlinearity and may offer advantages in future research which will investigate the effects of freeplay on the control of flutter in the typical section.},

The aerodynamic performance is evaluated using the Euler equations discretized on body-conforming multiblock meshes. The design process is greatly accelerated by the use of control theory for the calculation of sensitivity information and the implementation of the method on distributed memory parallel computers. Whereas the first paper of the series (Reuther, J. J., Jameson, A., Alonso, J. J., Rimlinger, M.

More specifically, the accuracy of the adjoint-based sensitivity information is examined and compared with the sensitivities provided by the finite difference method. The parallel scalability of the design method is analyzed and demonstrated. Aerodynamic performance improvements are obtained for example wing design problems using both multipoint drag minimization and single-point inverse techniques. Design examples include both transonic and supersonic cases and involve wing aerodynamic design in the presense of complex aircraft configurations with all resulting configurations satisfying geometric constraints.},

  abstract = {As traditional scientific disciplines individually grow towards their maturity, many new opportunities for significant advances lie at their intersection. For example, remarkable developments in control theory in the last few decades have considerably expanded the selection of available tools which may be applied to regulate physical and electrical systems. These techniques hold great promise for several applications in fluid mechanics, including the delay of transition and the regulation of turbulence. Such applications of control theory require a very balanced perspective, in which one considers the relevant flow physics when designing the control algorithms and, conversely, takes into account the requirements and limitations of control algorithms when designing both reduced-order flow models and the fluid-mechanical systems to be controlled themselves. Such a balanced perspective is elusive, however, as both the research establishment in general and universities in particular are accustomed only to the dissemination and teaching of component technologies in isolated fields. To advance, we must not toss substantial new interdisciplinary questions over the fence for fear of them being `outside our area'; rather, we must break down these very fences that limit us, and attack these challenging new questions with a Renaissance approach. In this spirit, this paper surveys a few recent attempts at bridging the gaps between the several scientific disciplines comprising the field of flow control, in an attempt to clarify the author's perspective on how recent advances in these constituent disciplines fit together in a manner that opens up significant new research opportunities.},

  abstract = {Direct numerical simulations (DNS) and optimal control theory are used in a predictive control setting to determine controls that effectively reduce the turbulent kinetic energy and drag of a turbulent flow in a plane channel at Ret = 100 and Ret = 180. Wall transpiration (unsteady blowing/suction) with zero net mass flux is used as the control. The algorithm used for the control optimization is based solely on the control objective and the nonlinear partial differential equation governing the flow, with no ad hoc assumptions other than the finite prediction horizon, T, over which the control is optimized. Flow relaminarization, accompanied by a drag reduction of over 50%, is obtained in some of the control cases with the predictive control approach in direct numerical simulations of subcritical turbulent channel flows. Such performance far exceeds what has been obtained to date in similar flows (using this type of actuation) via adaptive strategies such as neural networks, intuition-based strategies such as opposition control, and the so-called 'suboptimal' strategies, which involve optimizations over a vanishingly small prediction horizon T+ → 0. To achieve flow relaminarization in the predictive control approach, it is shown that it is necessary to optimize the controls over a sufficiently long prediction horizon T+ ≳ 25. Implications of this result are discussed. The predictive control algorithm requires full flow field information and is computationally expensive, involving iterative direct numerical simulations. It is, therefore, impossible to implement this algorithm directly in a practical setting. However, these calculations allow us to quantify the best possible system performance given a certain class of flow actuation and to qualify how optimized controls correlate with the near-wall coherent structures believed to dominate the process of turbulence production in wall-bounded flows. Further, various approaches have been proposed to distil practical feedback schemes from the predictive control approach without the suboptimal approximation, which is shown in the present work to restrict severely the effectiveness of the resulting control algorithm. The present work thus represents a further step towards the determination of optimally effective yet implementable control strategies for the mitigation or enhancement of the consequential effects of turbulence.},

We demonstrate that Fréchet derivatives for tomographic and (finite) source inversions may be obtained based upon just two numerical simulations for each earthquake: one calculation for the current model and a second, 'adjoint', calculation that uses time-reversed signals at the receivers as simultaneous, fictitious sources. For a given model, m, we consider objective functions χ (m) that minimize differences between waveforms, traveltimes or amplitudes. For tomographic inversions we show that the Fréchet derivatives of such objective functions may be written in the generic form δχ = V K m (x)δ ln m(x) d 3 x, where δ ln m = δm/m denotes the relative model perturbation. The volumetric kernel K m is defined throughout the model volume V and is determined by time-integrated products between spatial and temporal deriva-tives of the regular displacement field s and the adjoint displacement field s ; the latter is obtained by using time-reversed signals at the receivers as simultaneous sources. In wave-form tomography the time-reversed signal consists of differences between the data and the synthetics, in traveltime tomography it is determined by synthetic velocities, and in amplitude tomography it is controlled by synthetic displacements. For each event, the construction of the kernel K m requires one forward calculation for the regular field s and one adjoint cal-culation involving the fields s and s .

  abstract = {ABSTRACT This article surveys a general approach to error control and adaptive mesh design in Galerkin finite element methods that is based on duality principles as used in optimal control. Most of the existing work on a posteriori error analysis deals with error estimation in global norms like the energy norm or the L2 norm, involving usually unknown stability constants. However, in most applications, the error in a global norm does not provide useful bounds for the errors in the quantities of real physical interest. Further, their sensitivity to local error sources is not properly represented by global stability constants. These deficiencies are overcome by employing duality techniques, as is common in a priori error analysis of finite element methods, and replacing the global stability constants by computationally obtained local sensitivity factors. Combining this with Galerkin orthogonality, a posteriori estimates can be derived directly for the error in the target quantity. In these estimates local residuals of the computed solution are multiplied by weights which measure the dependence of the error on the local residuals. Those, in turn, can be controlled by locally refining or coarsening the computational mesh. The weights are obtained by approximately solving a linear adjoint problem. The resulting a posteriori error estimates provide the basis of a feedback process for successively constructing economical meshes and corresponding error bounds tailored to the particular goal of the computation. This approach, called the dual-weighted-residual method, is introduced initially within an abstract functional analytic setting, and is then developed in detail for several model situations featuring the characteristic properties of elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic problems. After having discussed the basic properties of duality-based adaptivity, we demonstrate the potential of this approach by presenting a selection of results obtained for practical test cases. These include problems from viscous fluid flow, chemically reactive flow, elasto-plasticity, radiative transfer, and optimal control. Throughout the paper, open theoretical and practical problems are stated together with references to the relevant literature.},

  abstract  = {The aim of the paper is to demonstrate the numerical feasibility of 4-D variational assimilation using a multilevel primitive-equation model. The experiments consist in minimizing the distance between the model solution and the observations. The gradient of the cost function thus defined is computed by integrating the adjoint of the model.Here, assimilations are performed using model-generated observations. In a preliminary set of experiments, assimilations were performed assuming that observations consisting of a full-model-state vector are available only at the end of the assimilation period. The numerical convergence of the method is proved and the results are meteorologically realistic. The use of the Machenhauer nonlinear normal mode initialization scheme and its adjoint turned out to have hastened the convergence and to have controlled to some extent the amount of gravity waves appearing in the solution. We identify a loss of conditioning of the minimization problem with an increase in the length of the assimilation period. The presence of horizontal diffusion in the model has the effect of degrading the convergence.The second set of experiments evaluates the impact of observations distributed over the whole assimilation period. Through different senarios of sets of observations, we demonstrate the efficiency of the 4-D variational approach in extracting the information contained in the dynamics of the model, together with the information contained in the observations. In particular, observing only the small scales of the flow leads to a good reconstruction of both small scales and large scales. Observations of the mass-field evolution lead to a good reconstruction of the vorticity field in mid latitudes but less so in the tropics.Increased resolution in the model in the experiments was found to have a negative impact on the speed of convergence of the minimization algorithm.},

For this reason, the adjoints of various models and their\napplications have been appearing more and more frequently in meteorological\nresearch. This paper is a bibliography in chronological order of\npublished works in meteorology dealing with adjoints which have appeared\nprior to this issue of Tellus.

  abstract = {Let f be a diffeomorphism of a manifold M , and ρ f a (generalized) SRB state for f . If suppρ f is a hyperbolic compact set we show that the map f → ρ f is differentiable in a suitable functional setup, and we compute the derivative. When suppρ f is an attractor, the derivative is given by δρ f () = ∞ n=0 ρ f grad(• f n), X where X is the vector field δf • f −1 . This formula can be extended to time dependent situations and also, at least formally, to nonuniformly hyperbolic situations. The above results will find their use in the study of the Onsager reciprocity relations and the fluctuation-dissipation formula of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. 0. Introduction In a recent paper [7], G.Gallavotti has outlined a new proof of Onsager's reciprocity relations, based on the study of the SRB measure ρ f for a hyperbolic dynamical system (M, f). To give a rigorous and general version of Gallavotti's argument, one has to study the dependence f → ρ f , and in particular compute the derivative. In fact, one may argue that these problems are at the core of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics; they are the subject of the present paper. We do not make here the assumption of [7] that we are close to a Hamiltonian situation (where f has a smooth invariant measure); our analysis will thus be valid " far from equilibrium " . In what follows we concentrate on the mathematics, and leave the application to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics for other occasions. Let K be a mixing Axiom A attractor for the diffeomorphism f . In a suitable func-tional setup we shall show that the SRB state ρ f on K depends differentiably on f . A},

The decoupling of the physical and spurious subspaces is defined by the absence of tangencies between them and found to take place generally; we find evidence in partial differential equations in one and two spatial dimensions and even in lattices of coupled maps or oscillators.

Object-orientation techniques enable the creation of data types that closely mimic those of continuum mechanics, and the operator overloading possible in C++ allows normal mathematical symbols to be used for the basic operations. As an example, the implementation of various types of turbulence modeling in a FOAM computational-fluid-dynamics code is discussed. and calculations performed on a standard test case, that of flow around a square prism, are presented.

  abstract = {Flow over elliptic cylinders can be considered prototypical of flow over a range of bluff bodies since the geometry allows one to study the effect of both thickness and angle-of-attack on the flow field. Therefore, a careful study of this flow should provide valuable insight into the phenomenon of unsteady separation and the structure of bluff body wakes. With this in mind, a spectral collocation technique has been developed to simulate the full three-dimensional incompressible flow over elliptic cylinders and, unlike spectral element and spectral multidomain techniques, here the flow is solved in a single domain. The equations are discretized on a body-fitted elliptic cylindrical grid and properties of the metric associated with this coordinate system are used to solve the governing equations in an efficient manner. Key issues including the inflow and outflow boundary conditions and time-discretization are discussed in detail with the hope that this will facilitate future simulations of similar flows. Finally, we present results of two- and three-dimensional simulations for a range of flow and geometric parameters. The results are compared with available experimental data and it is found that important quantities like Strouhal numbers and drag coefficients match well with established values.},

  abstract = {% It has been known for some time that two-dimensional numerical simulations of flow over nominally two-dimensional bluff bodies at Reynolds numbers for which the flow is intrinsically three dimensional, lead to inaccurate prediction of the lift and drag forces. In particular, for flow past a normal flat plate (International Symposium on Nckzsteady Fluid Dynamics, edited by J. A. Miller and D. P. Telionis, 1990, pp. 455-464) and circular cylinders [J. Wmd Eng. Indus. Aerodyn. 35,275 (1990)], it has been noted that the drag coefficient computed from two-dimensional simulations is significantly higher than what is obtained from experiments. Furthermore, it has been found that three-dimensional simulations of flows lead to accurate prediction of drag [J. Wind Eng. Indus. Aerodyn. 35, 275 (1990)]. Th e underlying cause for this discrepancy is that the surface pressure distribution obtained from two-dimensional simulations does not match up with that obtained from experiments and three-dimensional simulations and a number of reasons have been put forward to explain this discrepancy. However, the details of the physical mechanisms that ultimately lead to the inaccurate prediction of surface pressure and consequently the lift and drag, are still not clear. In the present study, results of two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations of flow past elliptic and circular cylinders have been systematically compared in an effort to pinpoint the exact cause for the inaccurate prediction of the lift and drag by two-dimensional simulations. The overprediction of mean drag force in two-dimensional simulations is directly traced to higher Reynolds stresses in the wake. It is also found that the discrepancy in the drag between two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations is more pronounced for bluffer cylinders. Finally, the current study also provides a detailed view of how the fluctuation, which are associated with the K&n& vortex shedding in the wake, affect the mean pressure distribution and the aerodynamic forces on the body.},

In the characteristic methods, waves are identified and manipulated at the boundaries, whereas the Tam and Dong approach use modified linearized Euler equations in a buffer zone near outlets to mimic a non-reflecting boundary. The principles of both approaches are recalled, and recent characteristic methods incorporating the treatment of transverse terms are discussed. Three characteristic techniquesthe original NavierStokes characteristic boundary conditions (NSCBC) of Poinsot and Lele and two versions of the modified method of Yoo and Imare compared with the Tam and Dong method for four typical aeroacoustics problems: vortex convection on a uniform flow, vortex convection on a shear flow, acoustic propagation from a monopole, and acoustic propagation from a dipole. Results demonstrate that the Tam and Dong method generally provides the best results and is a serious alternative solution to characteristic methods even though its implementation might require more care than the usual NSCBC approaches.

The two-dimensional chaotic flow around the NACA 0012 airfoil at a low Reynolds number and large angle of attack is considered to that end. Time, space and accuracy-order refinement studies are performed to examine each of these effects separately. Numerical results show that the time discretization has a small impact on the dynamics of the system, whereas the spatial discretization can dramatically change them. Also, the finite-time Lyapunov exponents associated to unstable modes are shown to be positively skewed, and quasi-homoclinic tangencies are observed in the attractor of the system. The implications of these results on flow physics and sensitivity analysis of chaotic flows are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper develops the Non-Intrusive Least Squares Shadowing (NILSS) method, which computes the sensitivity for long-time averaged objectives in chaotic dynamical systems. In NILSS, we represent a tangent solution by a linear combination of one inhomogeneous tangent solution and several homogeneous tangent solutions. Next, we solve a least squares problem using this representation; thus, the resulting solution can be used for computing sensitivities. NILSS is easy to implement with existing solvers. In addition, for chaotic systems with many degrees of freedom but few unstable modes, NILSS has a low computational cost. NILSS is applied to two chaotic PDE systems: the Lorenz 63 system and a CFD simulation of flow over a backward-facing step. In both cases, the sensitivities computed by NILSS reflect the trends in the long-time averaged objectives of dynamical systems.},

Covariant (or characteristic) Lyapunov vectors indicate these directions. Though the concept of these vectors is known for a long time, they became practically available only recently due to algorithms suggested by Ginelli et. al [Phys. Rev.

In view of the great interest in covariant Lyapunov vectors and their potential wide applications to the analysis of complex, high-dimensional dynamics, in this article we summarize available information related to Lyapunov vectors and provide a detailed explanation of both the theoretical basics, and numerical algorithms. For the theory of covariant Lyapunov vectors to be more consistent and complete we introduce the notion of adjoint covariant Lyapunov vectors. Moreover, we present and study in detail a new efficient approach for computing covariant Lyapunov vectors. Also we describe, how one can apply our method to test the hyperbolicity of chaotic dynamics without explicit computation of the covariant vectors.},

  abstract = {Sensitivity analysis methods are important tools for research and design with compu- tational models like CFD. Traditional sensitivity analysis methods are unable to compute useful gradient information for long time averaged quantities in chaotic dynamical sys- tems, such as high fidelity simulations of turbulent fluid flows. The Least Squares Shad- owing (LSS) method has been used to compute useful gradient information for a number of chaotic systems, including a simulation of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. However, some LSS gradient calculations for the Kuramoto-Sivshinsky (K-S) equation and the Lorenz 96 system have a systematic error due to breaks in the assumption of ergodicity. Since these systems have similar characteristics to turbulent fluid flows, this ergodicity breaking error must be minimized. This paper proposes a new approach using LSS, Multiple Shooting Shadowing (MSS), which uses the multiple shooting implementation of LSS to reduce the size of the ergodicity breaking error by not running the multiple shooting algorithm to full convergence. This way, gradients are computed from an ensemble of solutions, rather than the shadow direction alone, making the method more robust to the ergodicity breaking error. In this paper, MSS is demonstrated for the K-S equation and it is found that MSS cannot fix the systematic error of LSS when the system has a wide range of chaotic time scales. I.},

  abstract = {Summary form only given, as follows. Deterministic chaos arises in a variety of nonlinear dynamical systems in physics, and in particular in optics. One has now gained a reasonable understanding of the onset of chaos in terms of the geometry of bifurcations and strange attractors. This geometric approach does not work for attractors of more than two or three dimensions. For these, however, ergodic theory provides new concepts: characteristic exponents, entropy, information dimension, which are reproducibly estimated from physical experiments. The characteristic exponents measure the rate of divergence by nearby trajectories of a dynamical system, the entropy measures the rate of information creation by the system, and the information dimension is a fractal dimension of particular interest. There are inequalities (or even identities) relating the entropy and information dimension to the characteristic exponents. The experimental measure of these ergodic quantities provides a numerical estimate of the instability of chaotic systems, and of the number of 'degrees of freedom' which they possess},

In the case of a turbulent viscous fluid, however, this simple idea is complicated by the phenomenon of intermittency. The author obtains rigorous upper bounds on the distribution of characteristic exponents in terms of dissipation. These bounds have a reasonable large volume behavior. For two-dimensional fluids a particularly striking result is obtained: the total information creation is bounded above by a fixed multiple of the total energy dissipation (at fixed viscosity). The distribution of characteristic exponents is estimated in an intermittent model of turbulence (U. Frisch et al., 1978) and it is found that a change of behavior occurs at the value D=2.6 of the self-similarity dimension (33 Refs.)},

  abstract = {We apply adjoint-based sensitivity analysis to a time-delayed thermo-acoustic system: a Rijke tube containing a hot wire. We calculate how the growth rate and frequency of small oscillations about a base state are affected either by a generic passive control element in the system (the structural sensitivity analysis) or by a generic change to its base state (the base-state sensitivity analysis). We illustrate the structural sensitivity by calculating the effect of a second hot wire with a small heat-release parameter. In a single calculation, this shows how the second hot wire changes the growth rate and frequency of the small oscillations, as a function of its position in the tube. We then examine the components of the structural sensitivity in order to determine the passive control mechanism that has the strongest influence on the growth rate. We find that a force applied to the acoustic momentum equation in the opposite direction to the instantaneous velocity is the most stabilizing feedback mechanism. We also find that its effect is maximized when it is placed at the downstream end of the tube. This feedback mechanism could be supplied, for example, by an adiabatic mesh. We illustrate the base-state sensitivity by calculating the effects of small variations in the damping factor, the heat-release time-delay coefficient, the heat-release parameter, and the hot-wire location.

  abstract = {We propose as a generalization of an idea of Ruelle to describe turbulent fluid flow a chaotic hypothesis for reversible dissipative many particle systems in nonequilibrium stationary states in general. This implies an extension of the zeroth law of thermodynamics to non equilibrium states and it leads to the identification of a unique distribution $\m$ describing the asymptotic properties of the time evolution of the system for initial data randomly chosen with respect to a uniform distribution on phase space. For conservative systems in thermal equilibrium the chaotic hypothesis implies the ergodic hypothesis. We outline a procedure to obtain the distribution $\m$: it leads to a new unifying point of view for the phase space behavior of dissipative and conservative systems. The chaotic hypothesis is confirmed in a non trivial, parameter--free, way by a recent computer experiment on the entropy production fluctuations in a shearing fluid far from equilibrium. Similar applications to other models are proposed, in particular to a model for the Kolmogorov--Obuchov theory for turbulent flow.},

  abstract = {Dimension is perhaps the most basic property of an attractor. In this paper we discuss a variety of different definitions of dimension, compute their values for a typical example, and review previous work on the dimension of chaotic attractors. The relevant definitions of dimension are of two general types, those depend only on metric properties, and those that depend on the frequency with which a typical trajectory visits different regions of the attractor. Both our example and the previous work that we review support the conclusion that all of the frequency dependent dimensions take on the same value, which we call the "dimension of the natural measure", and all of the metric dimensions take on a common value, which we call the "fractal dimension". Furthermore, the dimension of the natural measure is typically equal to the Lyapunov dimension, which is defined in terms of Lyapunov numbers, and thus is usually far easier to calculate than any other definition. Because it is computable and more physically relevant, we feel that the dimension of the natural measure is more important than the fractal dimension.},

  abstract  = {Using a coarse grained (16 X33 X8) numerical simulation, a lower bound on the Lyapunov dimension, D "SUB lambda" , of the attractor underlying turbulent, periodic Poiseuille flow at a pressure-gradient Reynolds number of 3200 has been calculated to be approximately 352. These results were obtained on a spatial domain with streamwise and spanwise periods of 1.6 pi, and correspond to a wall-unit Reynolds number of 80. Comparison of Lyapunov exponent spectra from this and a higher-resolution (16 X33 X16) simulation on the same domain shows these spectra to have a universal shape when properly scaled. Using these scaling properties, and a partial exponent spectrum from a still higher-resolution (32 X33 X32) simulation, we argue that the actual dimension of the attractor underlying motion on the given computational domain is approximately 780. The medium resolution calculation establishes this dimension as a strong lower bound on this computational domain while the partial exponent spectrum calculated at highest resolution provides some evidence that the attractor dimension in fully resolved turbulence is unlikely to be substantially larger. These calculations suggest that this periodic turbulent shear flow is deterministic chaos, and that a strange attractor does underly solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in such flows. However, the magnitude of the dimension measured invalidates any notion that the global dynamics of such turbulence can be attributed to the interaction of a few degrees of freedom. Dynamical systems theory has provided the first measurement of the complexity of fully developed turbulence; the answer has been found to be dauntingly high. (A)},

  abstract = {Numerical investigation of laminar, transitional and chaotic flows in converging-diverging channels are performed by direct numerical simulations in the Reynolds number range 10<Re<850. The temporal flow evolution and the onset of turbulence are investigated by combining classical fluid dynamics representations with dynamical system flow characterizations. Modern dynamical system techniques such as time-delay reconstructions of pseudophase spaces, autocorrelation functions, fractal dimensions and Eulerian Lyapunov exponents are used for the dynamical flow characterization of laminar, transitional and chaotic flow regimes. As a consequence of these flow characterizations, it is verified that the transitional flow evolves through intermediate states of periodicity, two-frequency quasi- periodicity, frequency-locking periodicity, and multiple- frequency quasi-periodicity before reaching a non-periodic unpredictable behaviour corresponding to low-dimensional deterministic chaos. Qualitative and quantitative differences in Eulerian dynamical flow parameters are identified to determine the predictability of transitional flows and to characterize chaotic, weak turbulent flows in converging-diverging channels. Autocorrelation functions, pseudophase space representations and Poincare maps are used for the qualitative identification of chaotic flows, assertion of their unpredictable nature, and recognition of the topological structure of the attractors for different flow regimes (68 Refs.)},

  abstract = {The development of reduced models for complex multiscale problems remains one of the principal challenges in computational physics. The optimal prediction framework of Chorin et al. [1], which is a reformulation of the Mori–Zwanzig (M–Z) formalism of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, provides a framework for the development of mathematically-derived reduced models of dynamical systems. Several promising models have emerged from the optimal prediction community and have found application in molecular dynamics and turbulent flows. In this work, a new M–Z-based closure model that addresses some of the deficiencies of existing methods is developed. The model is constructed by exploiting similarities between two levels of coarse-graining via the Germano identity of fluid mechanics and by assuming that memory effects have a finite temporal support. The appeal of the proposed model, which will be referred to as the ‘dynamic-MZ-τ’ model, is that it is parameter-free and has a structural form imposed by the mathematics of the coarse-graining process (rather than the phenomenological assumptions made by the modeler, such as in classical subgrid scale models). To promote the applicability of M–Z models in general, two procedures are presented to compute the resulting model form, helping to bypass the tedious error-prone algebra that has proven to be a hindrance to the construction of M–Z-based models for complex dynamical systems. While the new formulation is applicable to the solution of general partial differential equations, demonstrations are presented in the context of Large Eddy Simulation closures for the Burgers equation, decaying homogeneous turbulence, and turbulent channel flow. The performance of the model and validity of the underlying assumptions are investigated in detail.},

  abstract = {The classical theory of linear response applies to statistical mechanics close to equilibrium. Away from equilibrium, one may describe the microscopic time evolution by a general differentiable dynamical system, identify nonequilibrium steady states (NESS), and study how these vary under perturbations of the dynamics. Remarkably, it turns out that for uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems (those satisfying the "chaotic hypothesis"), the linear response away from equilibrium is very similar to the linear response close to equilibrium: the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations hold, and the fluctuation-dispersion theorem survives in a modified form (which takes into account the oscillations around the "attractor" corresponding to the NESS). If the chaotic hypothesis does not hold, two new phenomena may arise. The first is a violation of linear response in the sense that the NESS does not depend differentiably on parameters (but this nondifferentiability may be hard to see experimentally). The second phenomenon is a violation of the dispersion relations: the susceptibility has singularities in the upper half complex plane. These "acausal" singularities are actually due to "energy nonconservation": for a small periodic perturbation of the system, the amplitude of the linear response is arbitrarily large. This means that the NESS of the dynamical system under study is not "inert" but can give energy to the outside world. An "active" NESS of this sort is very different from an equilibrium state, and it would be interesting to see what happens for active states to the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem.},

We investigate the geometry of such perturbations by constructing the covariant Lyapunov vectors of the unperturbed system and discover in one specific case–orographic forcing–a substantial projection of the forcing onto the stable directions of the flow. This results into a resonant response shaped as a Rossby-like wave that has no resemblance to the unforced variability in the same range of spatial and temporal scales. Such a climatic surprise corresponds to a violation of the fluctuation–dissipation theorem, in agreement with the basic tenets of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The resonance can be attributed to a specific group of rarely visited unstable periodic orbits of the unperturbed system. Our results reinforce the idea of using basic methods of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and high-dimensional chaotic dynamical systems to approach the problem of understanding climate dynamics.},

  abstract  = {The provision of accurate methods for predicting the climate response to anthropogenic and natural forcings is a key contemporary scientific challenge. Using a simplified and efficient open-source general circulation model of the atmosphere featuring O($10^5$) degrees of freedom, we show how it is possible to approach such a problem using nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. Response theory allows one to practically compute the time-dependent measure supported on the pullback attractor of the climate system, whose dynamics is non-autonomous as a result of time-dependent forcings. We propose a simple yet efficient method for predicting - at any lead time and in an ensemble sense - the change in climate properties resulting from increase in the concentration of CO$_2$ using test perturbation model runs. We assess strengths and limitations of the response theory in predicting the changes in the globally averaged values of surface temperature and of the yearly total precipitation, as well as in their spatial patterns. The quality of the predictions obtained for the surface temperature fields is rather good, while in the case of precipitation a good skill is observed only for the global average. We also show how it is possible to define accurately concepts like the the inertia of the climate system or to predict when climate change is detectable given a scenario of forcing. Our analysis can be extended for dealing with more complex portfolios of forcings and can be adapted to treat, in principle, any climate observable. Our conclusion is that climate change is indeed a problem that can be effectively seen through a statistical mechanical lens, and that there is great potential for optimizing the current coordinated modelling exercises run for the preparation of the subsequent reports of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change.},

The introduction addresses the physical motivation, focussing on the basic concept of modern statistical physics, that is the notion of Gibbsian random fields. Properties of Gibbsian fields are analyzed in two ranges of physical parameters: ``regular'' (corresponding to high-temperature and low-density regimes) where no phase transition is exhibited, and ``singular'' (low temperature regimes) where such transitions occur. Next, a detailed approach to the analysis of the phenomena of phase transitions of the first kind, the Pirogov-Sinai theory, is presented. The author discusses this theory in a general way and illustrates it with the example of a lattice gas with three types of particles. The conclusion gives a brief review of recent developments arising from this theory. The volume is written for the beginner, yet advanced students will benefit from it as well. The book will serve nicely as a supplementary textbook for course study. The prerequisites are an elementary knowledge of mechanics, probability theory and functional analysis.},

On the one hand we show how to build such a network, on the other hand we provide a method to check if a neural network is a chaotic one. Finally, the ability of classical feedforward multilayer perceptrons to learn sets of data obtained from a dynamical system is regarded. Various Boolean functions are iterated on finite states. Iterations of some of them are proven to be chaotic as it is defined by Devaney. In that context, important differences occur in the training process, establishing with various neural networks that chaotic behaviors are far more difficult to learn.},

We present a computational model based on the biology of the relevant visual pathways that learns to reliably recognize 100 different object categories in the face of naturally occurring variability in location, rotation, size, and lighting. The model exhibits robustness to highly ambiguous, partially occluded inputs. Both the unified, biologically plausible learning mechanism and the robustness to occlusion derive from the role that recurrent connectivity and recurrent processing mechanisms play in the model. Furthermore, this interaction of recurrent connectivity and learning predicts that high-level visual representations should be shaped by error signals from nearby, associated brain areas over the course of visual learning. Consistent with this prediction, we show how semantic knowledge about object categories changes the nature of their learned visual representations, as well as how this representational shift supports the mapping between perceptual and conceptual knowledge. Altogether, these findings support the potential importance of ongoing recurrent processing throughout the brain's visual system and suggest ways in which object recognition can be understood in terms of interactions within and between processes over time.},

We investigate the mechanism for this phenomenon and study the transport and mixing of fluid in this flow. Our work consists of both numerical and analytical studies. The analytical studies include the interpretation of the invariant manifolds as the underlying structure which govern the transport. For small values of strain-rate amplitude we use Melnikov's technique to investigate the behaviour of the manifolds as the parameters of the problem change and to prove the existence of a horseshoe map and thus the existence of chaotic particle paths in the flow. Using the Melnikov technique once more we develop an analytical estimate of the flux rate into and out of the vortex neighbourhood. We then develop a technique for determining the residence time distribution for fluid particles near the vortices that is valid for arbitrary strainrate amplitudes. The technique involves an understanding of the geometry of the tangling of the stable and unstable manifolds and results in a dramatic reduction in computational effort required for the determination of the residence time distributions. Additionally, we investigate the total stretch of material elements while they are in the vicinity of the vortex pair, using this quantity as a measure of the effect of the horseshoes on trajectories passing through this region. The numerical work verifies the analytical predictions regarding the structure of the invariant manifolds, the mechanism for entrainment and detrainment and the flux rate. },

  abstract = {This report investigates the dynamical stability conjectures of Palis and Smale and Pugh and Shub from the standpoint of numerical observation and lays the foundation for a stability conjecture. As the dimension of a dissipative dynamical system is increased, it is observed that the number of positive Lyapunov exponents increases monotonically, the Lyapunov exponents tend towards continuous change with respect to parameter variation, the number of observable periodic windows decreases (at least below numerical precision) and a subset of parameter space exists such that topological change is very common with small parameter perturbation. However, this seemingly inevitable topological variation is never catastrophic (the dynamic type is preserved) if the dimension of the system is high enough.},

  abstract = {Methods and computing hardware advances have enabled accurate predictions of complex compressible turbulence phenomena, such as the generation of jet noise that motivates the present effort. However, limited understanding of underlying physical mechanisms restricts the utility of such predictions since they do not, by themselves, indicate a route to design improvements. Gradient-based optimization using adjoints can circumvent the flow complexity to guide designs, though this is predicated on the availability of a sufficiently accurate solution of the forward and adjoint systems. These are challenging to obtain, since both the chaotic character of the turbulence and the typical use of discretizations near their resolution limits in order to efficiently represent its smaller scales will amplify any approximation errors made in the adjoint formulation. Formulating a practical exact adjoint that avoids such errors is especially challenging if it is to be compatible with state-of-the-art simulation methods used for the turbulent flow itself. Automatic differentiation (AD) can provide code to calculate a nominally exact adjoint, but existing general-purpose AD codes are inefficient to the point of being prohibitive for large-scale turbulence simulations. Here, we analyze the compressible flow equations as discretized using the same high-order workhorse methods used for many high-fidelity compressible turbulence simulations, and formulate a practical space-time discrete-adjoint method without changing the basic discretization. A key step is the definition of a particular discrete analog of the continuous norm that defines our cost functional; our selection leads directly to an efficient Runge-Kutta-like scheme, though it would be just first-order accurate if used outside the adjoint formulation for time integration, with finite-difference spatial operators for the adjoint system. Its computational cost only modestly exceeds that of the flow equations. We confirm that its accuracy is limited by computing precision, and we demonstrate it on the aeroacoustic control of a mixing layer with a challengingly broad range of turbulence scales. For comparison, the error from a corresponding discretization of the continuous-adjoint equations is quantified to potentially explain its limited success in past efforts to control jet noise. The differences are illuminating: the continuous-adjoint is shown to suffer from exponential error growth in (reverse) time even for the best-resolved largest turbulence scales. Implications for jet noise reduction and turbulence control in general are discussed.},

The current paper proves gradient descent achieves zero training loss in polynomial time for a deep over-parameterized neural network with residual connections (ResNet). Our analysis relies on the particular structure of the Gram matrix induced by the neural network architecture. This structure allows us to show the Gram matrix is stable throughout the training process and this stability implies the global optimality of the gradient descent algorithm. Our bounds also shed light on the advantage of using ResNet over the fully connected feedforward architecture; our bound requires the number of neurons per layer scaling exponentially with depth for feedforward networks whereas for ResNet the bound only requires the number of neurons per layer scaling polynomially with depth. We further extend our analysis to deep residual convolutional neural networks and obtain a similar convergence result.},

We train our network with gradient descent on $\mathbf\{w\}$ to mimic the output of a teacher network with the same architecture and fixed parameters $\mathbf\{w\}^*$. We show that its population gradient has an analytical formula, leading to interesting theoretical analysis of critical points and convergence behaviors. First, we prove that critical points outside the hyperplane spanned by the teacher parameters ("out-of-plane") are not isolated and form manifolds, and characterize in-plane critical-point-free regions for two ReLU case. On the other hand, convergence to $\mathbf\{w\}^*$ for one ReLU node is guaranteed with at least $(1-\epsilon)/2$ probability, if weights are initialized randomly with standard deviation upper-bounded by $O(\epsilon/\sqrt\{d\})$, consistent with empirical practice. For network with many ReLU nodes, we prove that an infinitesimal perturbation of weight initialization results in convergence towards $\mathbf\{w\}^*$ (or its permutation), a phenomenon known as spontaneous symmetric-breaking (SSB) in physics. We assume no independence of ReLU activations. Simulation verifies our findings.},

We also show that with constant probability, the same procedure could also converge to the spurious local minimum, showing that the local minimum plays a non-trivial role in the dynamics of gradient descent.

  abstract = {We show that the turbulence statistics from our (96)3 large-eddy-simulation (LES) studies of a convective boundary layer are in excellent agreement with those from the Deardorff–Willis laboratory convection tank. Using these LES data, we evaluate contemporary parameterizations for turbulent transport and dissipation in second-order closure models of the convective boundary layer. The gradient-diffusion parameterization for turbulent transport fares poorly, due in large part to the direct influence of buoyancy. This leads to poor predictions of the vertical profiles of some turbulence statistics. We also find that the characteristic length scales for the mechanical and thermal dissipation rates typically used in second-order closure models are a factor of 2–3 too small; this leads to underpredictions of turbulence kinetic energy levels. Finally, we find that the flux and variance budgets for conservative scalars are substantially different in top-down and bottom-up diffusion. In order to reproduce these differences accurately, it seems necessary to model the turbulent transport, pressure covariance, and molecular destruction terms differently in top-down and bottom-up diffusion.},

  abstract = {Over the past few years, high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) have emerged as a promising approach to solve complex turbulent flows. However, despite the significant research investment, the relation between the discretization scheme, the subgrid-scale (SGS) model and the resulting LES solver remains unclear. This paper aims to shed some light on this matter. In particular, we investigate the role of the Riemann solver, the SGS model, the time resolution, and the accuracy order in the ability to predict a variety of flow regimes, including transition to turbulence, wall-free turbulence, wall-bounded turbulence, and turbulence decay. The transitional flow over the Eppler 387 wing, the Taylor-Green vortex problem and the turbulent channel flow are considered to this end. The focus is placed on post-processing the LES results and provide with a rationale for the performance of the various approaches.},

The properties of a pair of neurons (one excitatory and the other inhibitory) connected with each other, is studied in detail. Even such a simple system shows a rich variety of behavior, including high-period oscillations and chaos. Border-collision bifurcations and multifractal fragmentation of the phase space is also observed for a range of parameter values. Extension of the model to a larger number of neurons is suggested under certain restrictive assumptions, which makes the resultant network dynamics effectively one-dimensional. Possible applications of the network for information processing are outlined. These include using the network for auto-association, pattern classification, nonlinear function approximation and periodic sequence generation.},

These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions.

  abstract = {Rigorous assessment of uncertainty is crucial to the utility of DNS results. Uncertainties in the computed statistics arise from two sources: finite statistical sampling and the discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations. Due to the presence of non-trivial sampling error, standard techniques for estimating discretization error (such as Richardson extrapolation) fail or are unreliable. This work provides a systematic and unified approach for estimating these errors. First, a sampling error estimator that accounts for correlation in the input data is developed. Then, this sampling error estimate is used as part of a Bayesian extension of Richardson extrapolation in order to characterize the discretization error. These methods are tested using the Lorenz equations and are shown to perform well. These techniques are then used to investigate the sampling and discretization errors in the DNS of a wall-bounded turbulent flow. For both cases, it is found that while the sampling uncertainty is large enough to make the order of accuracy difficult to determine, the estimated discretization errors are quite small. This indicates that the commonly used heuristics provide ad- equate resolution for this class of problems. However, it is also found that, for some quantities, the discretization error is not small relative to sampling error, indicating that the conventional wisdom that sampling error dominates discretization error for this class of simulations needs to be reevaluated.},

Results show that the maximum exponent increases with Reynolds number faster than the inverse Kolmogorov time scale, suggesting that the instability processes may be acting on length and time scales smaller than Kolmogorov scales.

In this paper, we develop distributed learning algorithms that are provably robust against such failures, with a focus on achieving optimal statistical performance. A main result of this work is a sharp analysis of two robust distributed gradient descent algorithms based on median and trimmed mean operations, respectively. We prove statistical error rates for three kinds of population loss functions: strongly convex, non-strongly convex, and smooth non-convex. In particular, these algorithms are shown to achieve order-optimal statistical error rates for strongly convex losses. To achieve better communication efficiency, we further propose a median-based distributed algorithm that is provably robust, and uses only one communication round. For strongly convex quadratic loss, we show that this algorithm achieves the same optimal error rate as the robust distributed gradient descent algorithms.},

  abstract = {Gradient-based approaches to direct policy search in reinforcement learning have received much recent attention as a means to solve problems of partial observability and to avoid some of the problems associated with policy degradation in value-function methods. In this paper we introduce GPOMDP, a simulation-based algorithm for generating a biased estimate of the gradient of the average reward in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes POMDPs controlled by parameterized stochastic policies. A similar algorithm was proposed by (Kimura et al. 1995). The algorithm's chief advantages are that it requires storage of only twice the number of policy parameters, uses one free beta (which has a natural interpretation in terms of bias-variance trade-off), and requires no knowledge of the underlying state. We prove convergence of GPOMDP, and show how the correct choice of the parameter beta is related to the mixing time of the controlled POMDP. We briefly describe extensions of GPOMDP to controlled Markov chains, continuous state, observation and control spaces, multiple-agents, higher-order derivatives, and a version for training stochastic policies with internal states. In a companion paper (Baxter et al., this volume) we show how the gradient estimates generated by GPOMDP can be used in both a traditional stochastic gradient algorithm and a conjugate-gradient procedure to find local optima of the average reward.},

  abstract = {A well-behaved adjoint sensitivity technique for chaotic dynamical systems is presented. The method arises from the specialisation of established variational techniques to the unstable periodic orbits of the system. On such trajectories, the adjoint problem becomes a time periodic boundary value problem. The adjoint solution remains bounded in time and does not exhibit the typical unbounded exponential growth observed using traditional methods over unstable non-periodic trajectories (Lea et al., Tellus 52 (2000)). This enables the sensitivity of period averaged quantities to be calculated exactly, regardless of the orbit period, because the stability of the tangent dynamics is decoupled effectively from the sensitivity calculations. We demonstrate the method on two prototypical systems, the Lorenz equations at standard parameters and the Kuramoto-Sivashinky equation, a one-dimensional partial differential equation with chaotic behaviour. We report a statistical analysis of the sensitivity of these two systems based on databases of unstable periodic orbits of size 10^5 and 4x10^4, respectively. The empirical observation is that most orbits predict approximately the same sensitivity. The effects of symmetries, bifurcations and intermittency are discussed and future work is outlined in the conclusions.},

All global minima of $G$ correspond to the ground truth parameters. 3. The value and gradient of $G$ can be estimated using samples. With these properties, stochastic gradient descent on $G$ provably converges to the global minimum and learn the ground-truth parameters.

Despite its ease of implementation, SGDs are difficult to tune and parallelize. These problems make it challenging to develop, debug and scale up deep learning algorithms with SGDs. In this paper, we show that more sophisticated off-the-shelf optimization methods such as Limited memory BFGS (L-BFGS) and Conjugate gradient (CG) with line search can significantly simplify and speed up the process of pretraining deep algorithms. In our experiments, the difference between L-BFGS/CG and SGDs are more pronounced if we consider algorithmic extensions (e.g., sparsity regularization) and hardware extensions (e.g., GPUs or computer clusters). Our experiments with distributed optimization support the use of L-BFGS with locally connected networks and convolutional neural networks. Using L-BFGS, our convolutional network model achieves 0.69% on the standard MNIST dataset. This is a state-of-the-art result on MNIST among algorithms that do not use distortions or pretraining.},

We propose alternative "big batch" SGD schemes that adaptively grow the batch size over time to maintain a nearly constant signal-to-noise ratio in the gradient approximation. The resulting methods have similar convergence rates to classical SGD, and do not require convexity of the objective. The high fidelity gradients enable automated learning rate selection and do not require stepsize decay. Big batch methods are thus easily automated and can run with little or no oversight.},

In recent years, a push for efficiency for large-scale applications has lead to drastically large mini-batch sizes. However, two significant roadblocks remain for such large-batch variants. On one hand, increasing the number of workers introduces communication bottlenecks, and efficient algorithms need to be able to adapt to the changing computation vs. communication trade-offs in heterogeneous systems. On the other hand, independent of communication, large-batch variants do not generalize well. We argue that variants of recently proposed local SGD, which performs several update steps on a local model before communicating with other workers can solve both these problems. Our experiments show performance gains in training efficiency, scalability, and adaptivity to the underlying system resources. We propose a variant, post-local SGD that significantly improves the generalization performance of large batch sizes while reducing communication. Additionally, post-local SGD converges to flatter minima as opposed to large-batch methods, which can be understood by relating of local SGD to noise injection. Thus, local SGD is an enticing alternative to large-batch SGD.},

The convergence rate of this procedure matches the well-known convergence rate of gradient descent to first-order stationary points, up to log factors. When all saddle points are non-degenerate, all second-order stationary points are local minima, and our result thus shows that perturbed gradient descent can escape saddle points almost for free. Our results can be directly applied to many machine learning applications, including deep learning. As a particular concrete example of such an application, we show that our results can be used directly to establish sharp global convergence rates for matrix factorization. Our results rely on a novel characterization of the geometry around saddle points, which may be of independent interest to the non-convex optimization community.},

Using this property we show that stochastic gradient descent converges to a local minimum in a polynomial number of iterations. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that gives global convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent on non-convex functions with exponentially many local minima and saddle points. Our analysis can be applied to orthogonal tensor decomposition, which is widely used in learning a rich class of latent variable models.

Motivated by the fact that existing ODEs do not distinguish between two fundamentally different algorithms---Nesterov's accelerated gradient method for strongly convex functions (NAG-SC) and Polyak's heavy-ball method---we study an alternative limiting process that yields high-resolution ODEs. We show that these ODEs permit a general Lyapunov function framework for the analysis of convergence in both continuous and discrete time. We also show that these ODEs are more accurate surrogates for the underlying algorithms; in particular, they not only distinguish between NAG-SC and Polyak's heavy-ball method, but they allow the identification of a term that we refer to as "gradient correction" that is present in NAG-SC but not in the heavy-ball method and is responsible for the qualitative difference in convergence of the two methods. We also use the high-resolution ODE framework to study Nesterov's accelerated gradient method for (non-strongly) convex functions, uncovering a hitherto unknown result---that NAG-C minimizes the squared gradient norm at an inverse cubic rate. Finally, by modifying the high-resolution ODE of NAG-C, we obtain a family of new optimization methods that are shown to maintain the accelerated convergence rates of NAG-C for smooth convex functions.},

This report contains a thorough analysis of the locally constrained quadratic minimizations that arise as subproblems in the modified Newton iteration. Several promising alternatives are presented for solving these subproblems in ways that overcome certain theoretical difficulties exposed by this analysis. Very strong convergence results are presented concerning the minimization algorithm. In particular, the explicit use of second order information is justified by demonstrating that the iterates converge to a point which satisfies the second order necessary conditions for minimization. With the exception of very pathological cases this occurs whenever the algorithm is applied to problems with continuous second partial derivatives.

The method works by iteratively minimizing a quadratic model of the Lagrangian subject to a possibly relaxed linearization of the problem constraints and a trust region constraint. The model minimization may be done approximately with a dogleg-type approach. We show that this method is globally convergent even if singular or indefinite Hessian approximations are made. A second-order correction step that brings the iterates closer to the feasible set is described.},

Due to an increased interest of CLVs in applications, several algorithms were developed to compute them. The Ginelli algorithm is among the most commonly used. Although several properties of the algorithm have been analyzed, there exists no mathematically rigorous convergence proof yet. In this article we extend existing approaches in order to construct a projector-based convergence proof of Ginelli's algorithm. One of the main ingredients will be an asymptotic characterization of CLVs via the Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem.

However, the often complex loss landscapes of neural networks have made a theory of learning dynamics elusive. In this work, we show that for wide neural networks the learning dynamics simplify considerably and that, in the infinite width limit, they are governed by a linear model obtained from the first-order Taylor expansion of the network around its initial parameters. Furthermore, mirroring the correspondence between wide Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian processes, gradient-based training of wide neural networks with a squared loss produces test set predictions drawn from a Gaussian process with a particular compositional kernel. While these theoretical results are only exact in the infinite width limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the predictions of the original network and those of the linearized version even for finite practically-sized networks. This agreement is robust across different architectures, optimization methods, and loss functions.},

  abstract = {Conventional parametrization schemes in weather and climate prediction models describe the effects of subgrid-scale processes by deterministic bulk formulae which depend on local resolved-scale variables and a number of adjustable parameters. Despite the unquestionable success of such models for weather and climate prediction, it is impossible to justify the use of such formulae from first principles. Using low-order dynamical- systems models, and elementary results from dynamical-systems and turbulence theory, it is shown that even if unresolved scales only describe a small fraction of the total variance of the system, neglecting their variability can, in some circumstances, lead to gross errors in the climatology of the dominant scales. It is suggested that some of the remaining errors in weather and climate prediction models may have their origin in the neglect of subgrid-scale variability, and that such variability should be parametrized by non-local dynamically based stochastic parametrization schemes. Results from existing schemes are described, and mechanisms which might account for the impact of random parametrization error on planetary-scale motions are discussed. Proposals for the development of non-local stochastic-dynamic parametrization schemes are outlined, based on potential-vorticity diagnosis, singular-vector analysis and a simple stochastic cellular automaton model.},

  abstract = {The optimally time-dependent (OTD) modes form a time-evolving orthonormal basis that captures directions in phase space associated with transient and persistent instabilities. In the original formulation, the OTD modes are described by a set of coupled evolution equations that need to be solved along the trajectory of the system. For many applications where real-time estimation of the OTD modes is important, such as control or filtering, this is an expensive task. Here, we examine the low-dimensional structure of the OTD modes. In particular, we consider the case of slow-fast systems, and prove that OTD modes rapidly converge to a slow manifold, for which we derive an asymptotic expansion. The result is a parametric description of the OTD modes in terms of the system state in phase space. The analytical approximation of the OTD modes allows for their online computation, making the whole framework suitable for real-time applications. In addition, we examine the accuracy of the slow-manifold approximation for systems in which there is no explicit time-scale separation. In this case, we show numerically that the asymptotic expansion of the OTD modes is still valid for regions of the phase space where strongly transient behavior is observed, and for which there is an implicit scale separation. We also find an analogy between the OTD modes and the Gram–Schmidt vectors (also known as orthogonal or backward Lyapunov vectors), and thereby establish new properties of the former. Several examples of low-dimensional systems are provided to illustrate the analytical formulation.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The stability properties of intermediate-order climate models are investigated by computing their Lyapunov exponents (LEs). The two models considered are PUMA (Portable University Model of the Atmosphere), a primitive-equation simple general circulation model, and MAOOAM (Modular Arbitrary-Order Ocean-Atmosphere Model), a quasi-geostrophic coupled ocean–atmosphere model on a β-plane. We wish to investigate the effect of the different levels of filtering on the instabilities and dynamics of the atmospheric flows. Moreover, we assess the impact of the oceanic coupling, the dissipation scheme, and the resolution on the spectra of LEs. The PUMA Lyapunov spectrum is computed for two different values of the meridional temperature gradient defining the Newtonian forcing to the temperature field. The increase in the gradient gives rise to a higher baroclinicity and stronger instabilities, corresponding to a larger dimension of the unstable manifold and a larger first LE. The Kaplan–Yorke dimension of the attractor increases as well. The convergence rate of the rate function for the large deviation law of the finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) is fast for all exponents, which can be interpreted as resulting from the absence of a clear-cut atmospheric timescale separation in such a model. The MAOOAM spectra show that the dominant atmospheric instability is correctly represented even at low resolutions. However, the dynamics of the central manifold, which is mostly associated with the ocean dynamics, is not fully resolved because of its associated long timescales, even at intermediate orders. As expected, increasing the mechanical atmosphere–ocean coupling coefficient or introducing a turbulent diffusion parametrisation reduces the Kaplan–Yorke dimension and Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy. In all considered configurations, we are not yet in the regime in which one can robustly define large deviation laws describing the statistics of the FTLEs. This paper highlights the need to investigate the natural variability of the atmosphere–ocean coupled dynamics by associating rate of growth and decay of perturbations with the physical modes described using the formalism of the covariant Lyapunov vectors and considering long integrations in order to disentangle the dynamical processes occurring at all timescales.},

In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned. Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.},

  abstract = {For the solution of the functional equation P (x) = 0 (1) (where P is an operator, usually linear, from B into B, and B is a Banach space) iteration methods are generally used. These consist of the construction of a series x0, ..., xn, ..., which converges to the solution (see, for example [1]). Continuous analogues of these methods are also known, in which a trajectory x(t), 0 ≤ t ≤ ∞ is constructed, which satisfies the ordinary differential equation in B and is such that x(t) approaches the solution of (1) as t → ∞ (see [2]). We shall call the method a k-step method if for the construction of each successive iteration xn+1 we use k previous iterations xn, ..., xn-k+1. The same term will also be used for continuous methods if x(t) satisfies a differential equation of the k-th order or k-th degree. Iteration methods which are more widely used are one-step (e.g. methods of successive approximations). They are generally simple from the calculation point of view but often converge very slowly. This is confirmed both by the evaluation of the speed of convergence and by calculation in practice (for more details see below). Therefore the question of the rate of convergence is most important. Some multistep methods, which we shall consider further, which are only slightly more complicated than the corresponding one-step methods, make it possible to speed up the convergence substantially. Note that all the methods mentioned below are applicable also to the problem of minimizing the differentiable functional (x) in Hilbert space, so long as this problem reduces to the solution of the equation grad (x) = 0. © 1964.},

Two different formulations of stability (boundedness in probability and boundedness in probability on average) are presented, and it is shown that these conditions are equivalent under the w.s.c. condition. These results are related to the ergodic behavior of $PHI by a set of results that includes the following: if $PHI is bounded in probability and w.s.c., then (i) sample path averages of functions of the state process converge for every initial condition, and (ii) if the stability is uniform then state process probabilities converge to a periodic orbit of probabilities. Finally, if the origin of an undriven system is globally attracting, the linearized system is controllable, and some technical conditions hold, then it is shown that $PHI is w.s.c.},

Although his exposition in this paper is quite terse and couched in mathematical language which may be difficult for some readers of Management Science to follow, it is thought that this presentation will: (1) make available to American readers generally an important work in the field of linear programming, (2) provide an indication of the type of analytic work which has been done and is being done in connection with rational planning in Russia, (3) through the specific examples mentioned indicate the types of interpretation which the Russians have made of the abstract mathematics (for example, the potential and field interpretations adduced in this country recently by W. Prager were anticipated in this paper). It is to be noted, however, that the problem of determining an effective method of actually acquiring the solution to a specific problem is not solved in this paper.

@article{batch_normalization,
  abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

However, its effectiveness diminishes when the training minibatches are small, or do not consist of independent samples. We hypothesize that this is due to the dependence of model layer inputs on all the examples in the minibatch, and different activations being produced between training and inference. We propose Batch Renormalization, a simple and effective extension to ensure that the training and inference models generate the same outputs that depend on individual examples rather than the entire minibatch. Models trained with Batch Renormalization perform substantially better than batchnorm when training with small or non-i.i.d. minibatches. At the same time, Batch Renormalization retains the benefits of batchnorm such as insensitivity to initialization and training efficiency.},

These computations are challenging for typical numerical methods in the presence of oscillations, which can originate from the internal structure of an autonomous dynamical system or be caused by an external periodic excitation. The case of periodic excitation is motivated by the problem of heat conduction in mechanical parts in engines, where the mean strength of the heat fluctuation can be an important parameter in the engineering design. In this work, approaches to transform periodically excited systems into autonomous systems appropriate for sensitivity analysis were investigated. The least-squares shadowing method is used to compute the sensitivities, and the effect of different kinds of transformation compared. The resulting numerical method is presented using the motivating example of heat conduction.},

This book aims to put such recent developments in a unified perspective, and to point out open problems and likely directions for further progress. It is aimed at researchers, both young and senior, willing to get a quick, yet broad, view of this part of dynamics. Main ideas, methods, and results are discussed, at variable degrees of depth, with references to the original works for details and complementary information.},

However, previous convergence proofs of shadowing methods wrongly assume that shadowing trajectories are representative. In contrast, the linear response formula is proved rigorously, but is more difficult to compute. In this paper, we first prove that the shadowing method computes a part of the linear response formula, which we call the shadowing contribution. Then we show that the error of shadowing is typically small for systems with small ratio of unstable directions. For partly reducing this error, we give a correction which can be easily implemented. Finally, we prove the convergence of the non-intrusive shadowing, the fastest shadowing algorithm, to the shadowing contribution.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study non-invertible hyperbolic maps f and the relation between the stable dimension (that is, the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection between local stable manifolds of f and a given basic set Λ) and the preimage counting function of the map f restricted to the fractal set Λ. The case of diffeomorphisms on surfaces was considered in [A. Manning and H. McCluskey, 'Hausdorff dimension for horseshoes', Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems 3 (1983) 251-260], where thermodynamic formalism was used to study the stable/unstable dimensions. In the case of endomorphisms, the non-invertibility generates new phenomena and new difficulties due to the overlappings coming from the different preimages of points, and also due to the variations of the number of preimages belonging to Λ (when compared with [E. Mihailescu and M. Urbanski, 'Estimates for the stable dimension for holomorphic maps', Houston J. Math. 31 (2005) 367-389]). We show that, if the number of preimages belonging to Λ of any point is less than or equal to a continuous function ω(·) on Λ, then the stable dimension at every point is greater than or equal to the zero of the pressure function t → P(tΦs-log ω(·)). As a consequence we obtain that, if d is the maximum value of the preimage counting function on Λ and if there exists x ∈ Λ with the stable dimension at x equal to the zero td of the pressure function t → P(t Φs - log d), then the number of preimages in Λ of any point y is equal to d, and the stable dimension is ttd everywhere on Λ. This has further consequences to estimating the stable dimension for non-invertible skew products with overlaps in fibers. © 2009 London Mathematical Society.},

The key ingredient is a new smoothness condition derived from practical neural network training examples. We observe that gradient smoothness, a concept central to the analysis of first-order optimization algorithms that is often assumed to be a constant, demonstrates significant variability along the training trajectory of deep neural networks. Further, this smoothness positively correlates with the gradient norm, and contrary to standard assumptions in the literature, it can grow with the norm of the gradient. These empirical observations limit the applicability of existing theoretical analyses of algorithms that rely on a fixed bound on smoothness. These observations motivate us to introduce a novel relaxation of gradient smoothness that is weaker than the commonly used Lipschitz smoothness assumption. Under the new condition, we prove that two popular methods, namely, gradient clipping and normalized gradient, converge arbitrarily faster than gradient descent with fixed stepsize. We further explain why such adaptively scaled gradient methods can accelerate empirical convergence and verify our results empirically in popular neural network training settings.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity of long-time averages of a hyperbolic chaotic system to parameter perturbations can be determined using the shadowing direction, the uniformly-bounded-in-time solution of the sensitivity equations. Although its existence is formally guaranteed for certain systems, methods to determine it are hardly available. One practical approach is the Least-Squares Shadowing (LSS) algorithm (Wang (2014) [18]), whereby the shadowing direction is approximated by the solution of the sensitivity equations with the least square average norm. Here, we present an alternative, potentially simpler shadowing-based algorithm, termed periodic shadowing. The key idea is to obtain a bounded solution of the sensitivity equations by complementing it with periodic boundary conditions in time. We show that this is not only justifiable when the reference trajectory is itself periodic, but also possible and effective for chaotic trajectories. Our error analysis shows that periodic shadowing has the same convergence rates as LSS when the time span T is increased: the sensitivity error first decays as 1/T and then, asymptotically as 1/T. We demonstrate the approach on the Lorenz equations, and also show that, as T tends to infinity, periodic shadowing sensitivities converge to the same value obtained from long unstable periodic orbits (Lasagna (2018) [14]) for which there is no shadowing error. Finally, finite-difference approximations of the sensitivity are also examined, and we show that subtle non-hyperbolicity features of the Lorenz system introduce a small, yet systematic, bias.},

  abstract = {The cluster expansion for the free energy of the Ising model is reinterpreted as a cluster expansion for the pressure of the lattice gas. It is observed that the free energy of the Ising model is a function of 1-R2, where R is the long-range order, so that the pressure of the lattice gas is a function of ρ(1-ρ), where ρ is density. The factor 1-ρ comes from the prevention of more than one particle occupying a lattice site. This idea has motivated the development of a real hard-core gas with a weak attractive tail. A cluster expansion is developed in terms of the tail alone and the hard core is treated as a metric (i.e., the hard-core part of the potential is treated exactly in all integrals). Pressure-volume isotherms are calculated explicitly in the zeroth order or molecular field approximation using the Lennard-Jones (6-12) potential and good quantitative results are found for the critical parameters as well as a qualitative understanding of the condensation phenomena. The theory of the first-order correction (spherical model) is then outlined and fluctuations of the Ornstein-Zernicke type in the local density are found. The theory of condensation is qualitatively understood in the sense that the Weiss field gives an understanding of ferromagnetism. The theory of the detailed fluctuations in the critical region is equally difficult for both phenomena since the problems are put on the same footing in the present paper. © 1963 The American Physical Society.},

  abstract = {    In an acoustic cavity with a heat source, such as a flame in a gas turbine, the thermal energy of the heat source can be converted into acoustic energy, which may generate a loud oscillation. If uncontrolled, these nonlinear acoustic oscillations, also known as thermoacoustic instabilities, can cause large vibrations up to structural failure. Numerical and experimental studies showed that thermoacoustic oscillations can be chaotic. It is not yet known, however, how to minimise such chaotic oscillations. We propose a strategy to analyse and minimise chaotic acoustic oscillations, for which traditional stability and sensitivity methods break down. We investigate the acoustics of a nonlinear heat source in an acoustic resonator. First, we propose covariant Lyapunov analysis as a tool to calculate the stability of chaotic acoustics, making connections with eigenvalue and Floquet analyses. We show that covariant Lyapunov analysis is the most general flow stability tool. Second, covariant Lyapunov vector analysis is applied to a chaotic system. The time-averaged acoustic energy is investigated by varying the heat-source parameters. Thermoacoustic systems can display both hyperbolic and non-hyperbolic chaos, as well as discontinuities in the time-averaged acoustic energy. Third, we embed sensitivities of the time-averaged acoustic energy in an optimisation routine. This procedure achieves a significant reduction in acoustic energy and identifies the bifurcations to chaos. The analysis and methods proposed enable the reduction of chaotic oscillations in thermoacoustic systems by optimal passive control. The techniques presented can be used in other unsteady fluid-dynamics problems with virtually no modification.},

  abstract = {A direct application of the unsteady output adjoint method for error estimation is not possible for chaotic flows due to their inherent sensitivity to the initial conditions and the exponential growth of their corresponding adjoint solutions. A method that has proven to provide accurate and usable output adjoints for chaotic flows is the least squares shadowing method (LSS), which was originally developed for sensitivity analysis. However, this approach has been shown to be costly, especially for larger simulations. Another method, the approximate time-windowing approach, has been shown to be cheaper to implement and execute. However, this method produces results that are not as accurate as that of LSS. In this paper, we choose to concentrate on reducing the computational cost associated with LSS by using reduced-order modeling (ROM) and hyper-reduced-order modeling (HROM). We first present a study on how accurate ROM and HROM can be for a chaotic system. We then introduce a combined reduced-order model, least squares shadowing method (HROM-LSS) for approximating output adjoints more accurately and more economically compared to previous approaches. Lastly, we present preliminary HROM-LSS results for the 1D chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) problem.},

  abstract = {Integrating existing solvers for unsteady partial differential equations into a simultaneous optimization method is challenging due to the forward-in-time information propagation of classical time-stepping methods. This paper applies the simultaneous single-step one-shot optimization method to a reformulated unsteady constraint that allows for both forward- and backward-in-time information propagation. Especially in the presence of chaotic and turbulent flow, solving the initial value problem simultaneously with the optimization problem often scales poorly with the time domain length. The new formulation relaxes the initial condition and instead solves a least squares problem for the discrete partial differential equations. This enables efficient one-shot optimization that is independent of the time domain length, even in the presence of chaos.},

The transition states are given by index-one saddle points of the energy surface. By constructing the rotation and translation steps in the classical dimer method under an optimization framework, we are able to take advantage of more powerful optimization methods to substantially speed up the computation of transition states. Specifically, the Barzilai-Borwein gradient method is proposed as an effective implementation of OSD. We show that the OSD method is the generalized formulation of the original shrinking dimer dynamics (SDD) and enjoys superlinear convergence. We test various numerical examples, including some standard lower dimensional test examples, a cluster of seven particles, seven-atom island on the (111) surface of an FCC crystal, and nucleation in phase transformations. The results demonstrate that the OSD method with the proposed Barzilai-Borwein stepsize is very effective and provides a more efficient implementation than the SDD algorithm and some other dimer-type methods. Our new algorithms offer potential to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in dimer-type methods for transition state search.},

First, we establish sufficient conditions for existence of certain stable random time-periodic orbits generated by the underlying SDE.

The reason is that turbulent flows exhibit chaotic dynamics, leading to the norm of an infinitesimal perturbation to the state growing exponentially in time. As a result, these conventional methods cannot be used to compute the derivatives of long-time averaged quantities to control or design inputs. The ensemble-based approaches [1, 2] and shadowing-based approaches ([3–5]) to circumvent the problems of the conventional methods in chaotic systems, also suffer from computational impracticality and lack of consistency guarantees, respectively.

We prove a decomposition of Ruelle's formula that is differentiable on the unstable manifold, which we assume to be one-dimensional. This decomposition of Ruelle's formula ensures that one of the resulting terms, the stable contribution, can be computed using a regularized tangent equation, similar to in a non-chaotic system. The remaining term, known as the unstable contribution, is regularized and converted into an efficiently computable ergodic average. In this process, we develop new algorithms, which may be useful beyond linear response, to compute i) a fundamental statistical quantity we introduce called the density gradient, and ii) the unstable derivatives of the regularized tangent vector field and the unstable direction. We prove that the S3 algorithm, which combines these computational ingredients that enter the stable and unstable contribution, converges like a Monte Carlo approximation of Ruelle's formula. The algorithm presented here is hence a first step toward full-fledged applications of sensitivity analysis in chaotic systems, wherever such applications have been limited due to lack of availability of long-term sensitivities.},

A prominent real-life example of this class of problems is the investigation of climate response to perturbations. In this respect, it is crucial to determine what the linear response of a system is as a quantification of sensitivity. Alongside previous work, here we use the transfer operator formalism to study the response and sensitivity of a dynamical system undergoing perturbations. By projecting the transfer operator onto a suitable finite dimensional vector space, one is able to obtain matrix representations which determine finite Markov processes. Further, using perturbation theory for Markov matrices, it is possible to determine the linear and nonlinear response of the system given a prescribed forcing. Here, we suggest a methodology which puts the scope on the evolution law of densities (the Liouville/Fokker–Planck equation), allowing to effectively calculate the sensitivity and response of two representative dynamical systems.},

  abstract = {We propose a preconditioner that can accelerate the rate of convergence of the Multiple Shooting Shadowing (MSS) method [1]. This recently proposed method can be used to compute derivatives of time-averaged objectives (also known as sensitivities) to system parameter( s) for chaotic systems. We propose a block diagonal preconditioner, which is based on a partial singular value decomposition of the MSS constraint matrix. The preconditioner can be computed using matrix-vector products only (i.e. it is matrix-free) and is fully parallelised in the time domain. Two chaotic systems are considered, the Lorenz system and the 1D Kuramoto Sivashinsky equation. Combination of the preconditioner with a regularisation method leads to tight bracketing of the eigenvalues to a narrow range. This combination results in a significant reduction in the number of iterations, and renders the convergence rate almost independent of the number of degrees of freedom of the system, and the length of the trajectory that is used to compute the time-averaged objective. This can potentially allow the method to be used for large chaotic systems (such as turbulent flows) and optimal control applications. The singular value decomposition of the constraint matrix can also be used to quantify the effect of the system condition on the accuracy of the sensitivities. In fact, neglecting the singular modes affected by noise, we recover the correct values of sensitivity that match closely with those obtained with finite differences for the Kuramoto Sivashinsky equation in the light turbulent regime.

Macroscopic observables of complex dissipative chaotic systems, however, are widely assumed to have a linear response even if the microscopic variables do not, but the mechanism for this is not well-understood. We present a comprehensive picture for the linear response of macroscopic observables in high-dimensional coupled deterministic dynamical systems, where the coupling is via a mean field and the microscopic subsystems may or may not obey linear response theory. We derive stochastic reductions of the dynamics of these observables from statistics of the microscopic system and provide conditions for linear response theory to hold in finite dimensional systems and in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we show that for large systems of finite size, the linear response is induced via self-generated noise. We present examples in the thermodynamic limit where the macroscopic observable satisfies linear response theory (LRT), although the microscopic subsystems individually violate LRT, as well as a converse example where the macroscopic observable does not satisfy LRT despite all microscopic subsystems satisfying LRT when uncoupled. This latter, maybe surprising, example is associated with emergent nontrivial dynamics of the macroscopic observable. We provide numerical evidence for our results on linear response as well as some analytical intuition.},

We describe the Nambu formulation of fluid dynamics and the potential of such a theory for constructing sophisticated numerical models of geophysical fluids. Then, we focus on the statistical mechanics of quasi-equilibrium flows in a rotating environment, which seems crucial for constructing a robust theory of geophysical turbulence. We then discuss ideas and methods suited for approaching directly the nonequilibrium nature of the climate system. First, we describe some recent findings on the thermodynamics of climate, characterize its energy and entropy budgets, and discuss related methods for intercomparing climate models and for studying tipping points. These ideas can also create a common ground between geophysics and astrophysics by suggesting general tools for studying exoplanetary atmospheres. We conclude by focusing on nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, which allows for a unified framing of problems as different as the climate response to forcings, the effect of altering the boundary conditions or the coupling between geophysical flows, and the derivation of parametrizations for numerical models.},

Accurate and efficient sensitivity analysis of such responses is necessary for successful application of design optimization to systems that exhibit chaotic dynamics. This paper presents a fundamentally new approach for sensitivity analysis of time-averaged quantities of chaotic systems. This includes the development of a stabilized time integrator with adaptive timestep control to maintain stability of the sensitivity calculations. Therefore, the approach maintains the initialvalue formulation of the problem and avoids costly boundary-value space-time formulation in the least-square shadowing approaches. Both direct- and adjoint-sensitivity analyses approaches are discussed. The method is then applied to the Lorenz system and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, where the sensitivity of time-averaged quantities is computed. The results show that the method provides a robust computational approach with effectively no extra cost other than to compute the sensitivity using a standard implicit time integrator for linear systems.},

  abstract = {The common techniques for solving two-point boundary value problemscan be classified as either "shooting" or "finite difference"methods. Central to a shooting method is the ability to integratethe differential equations as an initial value problem with guessesfor the unknown initial values. This ability is not required with afinite difference method, for the unknowns are considered to be thevalues of the true solution at a number of interior mesh points.Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. One seriousshortcoming of shooting becomes apparent when, as happensaltogether too often, the differential equations are so unstablethat they "blow up" before the initial value problem can becompletely integrated. This can occur even in the face of extremelyaccurate guesses for the initial values. Hence, shooting seems tooffer no hope for some problems. A finite difference method doeshave a chance for it tends to keep a firm hold on the entiresolution at once. The purpose of this note is to point out acompromising procedure which endows shooting-type methods with thisparticular advantage of finite difference methods. For suchproblems, then, all hope need not be abandoned for shootingmethods. This is desirable because shooting methods are generallyfaster than finite difference methods. The organization is as follows: I. The two-point boundary value problem is stated in quite generalform. II. A particular shooting method is described which is designed tosolve the problem in this form. III. The two-point boundary value problem is then restated in sucha way that: (a) the restatement still falls within the general form, and (b) the shooting method now has a better chance of success when theequations are unstable. © 1962, ACM.

Due to efficient algorithms to compute them that only utilize trajectory information, they have been widely applied across scientific disciplines, principally for sensitivity analysis and predictions under uncertainty. In this paper, we develop a numerical method to compute the directional derivatives of CLVs along their own directions. Similar to the computation of CLVs, the present method for their derivatives is iterative and analogously uses the second-order derivative of the chaotic map along trajectories, in addition to the Jacobian. We validate the new method on a super-contracting Smale-Williams Solenoid attractor. We also demonstrate the algorithm on several other examples including smoothly perturbed Arnold Cat maps, and the Lorenz attractor, obtaining visualizations of the curvature of each attractor. Furthermore, we reveal a fundamental connection of the CLV self-derivatives with a statistical linear response formula.},

In particular, we obtain new results on the stability of the rate function under deterministic perturbations. As a key application, we focus on perturbations arising from numerical schemes and develop two new Fourier-analytic methods for efficiently computing approximations of the aforementioned statistical properties. This includes the first example of a rigorous scheme for approximating the peripheral spectral data of the Perron–Frobenius operator of an Anosov map without mollification.

We develop a spectral Galerkin method for these maps’ transfer operators, estimating statistical quantities using finite submatrices of the transfer operators’ infinite Fourier or Chebyshev basis coefficient matrices. Rates of convergence of these estimates are obtained via quantitative bounds on the full transfer operator matrix entries; we find the method furnishes up to exponentially accurate estimates of statistical properties in only a polynomially large computational time. To implement these results we suggest and demonstrate two algorithms: a rigorously-validated algorithm, and a fast, more convenient adaptive algorithm. Using the first algorithm we prove rigorous bounds on some exemplar quantities that are substantially more accurate than previous. We show that the adaptive algorithm can produce double floating-point accuracy estimates in a fraction of a second on a personal computer.},

  abstract = {The long-term distributions of trajectories of a flow are described by invariant densities, i.e., fixed points of an associated transfer operator. In addition, global slowly mixing structures, such as almost-invariant sets, which partition phase space into regions that are almost dynamically disconnected, can also be identified by certain eigenfunctions of this operator. Indeed, these structures are often hard to obtain by brute-force trajectory-based analyses. In a wide variety of applications, transfer operators have proven to be very efficient tools for an analysis of the global behavior of a dynamical system. The computationally most expensive step in the construction of an approximate transfer operator is the numerical integration of many short-term trajectories. In this paper, we propose to directly work with the infinitesimal generator instead of the operator, completely avoiding trajectory integration. We propose two different discretization schemes: a cell based discretization and a spectral collocation approach. Convergence can be shown in certain circumstances. We demonstrate numerically that our approach is much more efficient than the operator approach, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. © 2013 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

Directional derivatives of SRB measure densities conditioned on unstable manifolds are critical in the sensitivity analysis of hyperbolic chaos.

In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory-driven algorithm for computing the SRB density gradient defined for systems with high-dimensional unstable manifolds. We apply the concept of measure preservation together with the chain rule on smooth manifolds. Due to the recursive one-step nature of our derivations, the proposed procedure is memory-efficient and can be naturally integrated with existing Monte Carlo schemes widely used in computational chaotic dynamics.

For singular physical measures, which are limits of an orbit, we show that we typically only need the transfer operator to handle the unstable derivatives. Then we derive a divergence formula for the unstable derivative of transfer operators, which has no exploding intermediate quantities.

  abstract = {Ruelle first proved a rigorous formula for linear response of smooth, transitive Anosov diffeomorphisms. Recently, practically computable realizations of Ruelle's formula have emerged that potentially enable sensitivity analysis of the high-dimensional chaotic numerical simulations such as encountered in climate studies. In this paper, we provide a rigorous convergence proof of one such efficient computation, the space-split sensitivity, or S3, algorithm for one-dimensional unstable manifolds. In S3, Ruelle's formula is computed as a sum of two terms obtained by decomposing the perturbation vector field into a coboundary and a remainder that is parallel to the unstable direction. Such a decomposition results in a splitting of Ruelle's formula that is amenable to efficient computation. We prove the existence of the S3 decomposition and the convergence of the computations of both resulting components of Ruelle's formula.},

  abstract  = {Chaotic dynamical systems are ubiquitous in engineering applications and, in order to help inform the design of such systems, we are interested in optimizing their performance using both plant and control parameters. Given the complex nature of such systems we focus on the use of gradient-based optimization algorithms, since the number of states and design parameters in practical engineering applications can easily exceed the capabilities of gradient-free approaches. Furthermore, optimal design and control of chaotic systems is challenging for gradient-based algorithms, because conventional sensitivity analysis methods (tangent and adjoint) produce unusable gradients. To address this challenge, we present a plant-control optimization framework that uses the least-squares shadowing method to estimate the objective gradient. We illustrate the effectiveness of the optimization framework by applying it to the plant-control design of potential vortices in a box, and demonstrate the robustness of the design process as well as the robustness of the optimized system to perturbations on its initial states and design parameters.},

Ruelle's linear response theory provides breakthrough mathematical machinery for computing the sensitivity of chaotic dynamical systems, which enables a better understanding of chaotic phenomena. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for sensitivity analysis of discrete chaos with an arbitrary number of positive Lyapunov exponents. We combine the concept of perturbation space-splitting regularizing Ruelle's original expression together with measure-based parameterization of the expanding subspace. We use these tools to rigorously derive trajectory-following recursive relations that exponentially converge, and construct a memory-efficient Monte Carlo scheme for derivatives of the output statistics. Thanks to the regularization and lack of simplifying assumptions on the behavior of the system, our method is immune to the common problems of other popular systems such as the exploding tangent solutions and unphysicality of shadowing directions. We provide a ready-to-use algorithm, analyze its complexity, and demonstrate several numerical examples of sensitivity computation of physically-inspired low-dimensional systems.},

When p= 1 and t is an integer, the spaces are analogous to the “geometric” spaces Bt,|s+t| considered by Gouëzel and Liverani (Ergod Theory Dyn Syst 26:189–217, 2006). When p> 1 and - 1 + 1 / p< s< - t< 0 < t< 1 / p, the spaces are somewhat analogous to the geometric spaces considered by Demers and Liverani (Trans Am Math Soc 360:4777–4814, 2008).

We show that h-shadowing, limit shadowing and s-limit shadowing properties are conjugacy invariant. Also, we investigate the relationships between these notions of shadowing for time varying maps and examine the role that expansivity plays in shadowing properties of such dynamical systems. Specially, we prove some results linking s-limit shadowing property to limit shadowing property, and h-shadowing property to s-limit shadowing and limit shadowing properties. Moreover, under the assumption of expansivity, we show that the shadowing property implies the h-shadowing, s-limit shadowing and limit shadowing properties. Finally, it is proved that the uniformly contracting and uniformly expanding time varying maps exhibit the shadowing, limit shadowing, s-limit shadowing and exponential limit shadowing properties.},

@article{Gottwald2016,
  abstract = {Using a sensitive statistical test we determine whether or not one can detect the breakdown of linear response given observations of deterministic dynam-ical systems. A goodness-of-fit statistics is developed for a linear statistical model of the observations, based on results on central limit theorems for deterministic dynamical systems, and used to detect linear response breakdown. We apply the method to discrete maps which do not obey linear response and show that the successful detection of breakdown depends on the length of the time series, the magnitude of the perturbation and on the choice of the observable. We find that in order to reliably reject the assumption of linear response for typical observables sufficiently large data sets are needed. Even for simple systems such as the logistic map, one needs of the order of 10 6 observations to reliably detect the breakdown with a confidence level of 95 percent; if less observations are available one may be falsely led to conclude that linear response theory is valid. The amount of data required is larger the smaller the applied perturbation. For judiciously chosen observables the necessary amount of data can be drastically reduced, but requires detailed a priori knowledge about the invariant measure which is typically not available for complex dynamical systems. Furthermore we explore the use of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) in cases with limited data length or coarse-graining of observations. The FDT, if applied naively to a system without linear response, is shown to be very sensitive to the details of the sampling method, resulting in erroneous predictions of the response.},

To this end, the PDEs are reformulated using backward stochastic differential equations and the gradient of the unknown solution is approximated by neural networks, very much in the spirit of deep reinforcement learning with the gradient acting as the policy function. Numerical results on examples including the nonlinear Black–Scholes equation, the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, and the Allen–Cahn equation suggest that the proposed algorithm is quite effective in high dimensions, in terms of both accuracy and cost. This opens up possibilities in economics, finance, operational research, and physics, by considering all participating agents, assets, resources, or particles together at the same time, instead of making ad hoc assumptions on their interrelationships.},

This leads one to reconsider notions such as "hubs". Then, we show examples where, with a suitable choice of the carrier frequency (resonance), one can transmit a signal from a node to another one by amplitude modulation, in spite of chaos. Also, we give an example where a signal, transmitted to any node via different paths, can only be recovered by a couple of specific nodes.

The highly influential chaotic hypothesis of Gallavotti and Cohen states that the large-scale dynamics of high-dimensional systems are effectively uniformly hyperbolic, which implies many felicitous statistical properties. We obtain direct and reliable numerical evidence, contrary to the chaotic hypothesis, of the existence of non-hyperbolic large-scale dynamical structures in a mean-field coupled system. To do this, we reduce the system to its thermodynamic limit, which we approximate numerically with a Chebyshev basis transfer operator discretization. This enables us to obtain a high-precision estimate of a homoclinic tangency, implying a failure of uniform hyperbolicity. Robust non-hyperbolic behaviour is expected under perturbation. As a result, the chaotic hypothesis should not be <italic>a priori</italic> assumed to hold in all systems, and a better understanding of the domain of its validity is required. </p>},

  abstract = {We present a frequency-domain method for computing the sensitivities of time-averaged quantities of chaotic systems with respect to input parameters. Such sensitivities cannot be computed by conventional adjoint analysis tools, because the presence of positive Lyapunov exponents leads to exponential growth of the adjoint variables. The proposed method is based on the least-square shadowing (LSS) approach [1], that formulates the evaluation of sensitivities as an optimisation problem, thereby avoiding the exponential growth of the solution. However, all existing formulations of LSS (and its variants) are in the time domain and the computational cost scales with the number of positive Lyapunov exponents. In the present paper, we reformulate the LSS method in the Fourier space using harmonic balancing. The new method is tested on the Kuramoto-Sivashinski system and the results match with those obtained using the standard time-domain formulation. Although the cost of the direct solution is independent of the number of positive Lyapunov exponents, storage and computing requirements grow rapidly with the size of the system. To mitigate these requirements, we propose a resolvent-based iterative approach that needs much less storage. Application to the Kuramoto-Sivashinski system gave accurate results with very low computational cost. The method is applicable to large systems and paves the way for application of the resolvent-based shadowing approach to turbulent flows. Further work is needed to assess its performance and scalability.},

  abstract = {In 1996, Edward Lorenz introduced a system of ordinary differential equations that describes a single scalar quantity as it evolves on a circular array of sites, undergoing forcing, dissipation, and rotation invariant advection. Lorenz constructed the system as a test problem for numerical weather prediction. Since then, the system has also found widespread use as a test case in data assimilation. Mathematically, it belongs to a class of dynamical systems with a single bifurcation parameter (rescaled forcing) that undergoes multiple bifurcations and exhibits chaotic behavior for large forcing. In this paper, the main characteristics of the advection term in the model are identified and used to describe and classify a number of possible generalizations of the system. A graphical method to study the bifurcation behavior of constant solutions is introduced, and it is shown how to use the rotation invariance to compute normal forms of the system analytically. Problems with site-dependent forcing, dissipation, or advection are considered and basic existence and stability results are proved for these extensions. We address some related topics in the appendices, wherein the Lorenz '96 system in Fourier space is considered, explicit solutions for some advection-only systems are found, and it is demonstrated how to use advection-only systems to assess numerical schemes.},

Although BP has been widely used, it still suffers from the problem of easily falling into the local minima due to its gradient dynamics. Inspired by the fact that the learning of real brains may exploit chaotic dynamics, we propose the chaotic backpropagation (CBP) algorithm by integrating the intrinsic chaos of real neurons into BP. By validating on multiple datasets (e.g. cifar10), we show that, for multilayer perception (MLP), CBP has significantly better abilities than those of BP and its variants in terms of optimization and generalization from both computational and theoretical viewpoints. Actually, CBP can be regarded as a general form of BP with global searching ability inspired by the chaotic learning process in the brain. Therefore, CBP not only has the potential of complementing or replacing BP in deep learning practice, but also provides a new way for understanding the learning process of the real brain.},

As a result, these conventional methods cannot be used to compute the derivatives of long-time averaged quantities to control or design inputs. The ensemble-based approaches [1, 2] and shadowing-based approaches ([3–5]) to circumvent the problems of the conventional methods in chaotic systems, also suffer from computational impracticality and lack of consistency guarantees, respectively. We introduce the space-split sensitivity, or the S3 algorithm, that is a Monte-Carlo approach to the chaotic sensitivity computation problem.

Despite this unpredictable behavior, for many dissipative systems the statistics of the long term trajectories are governed by an invariant measure supported on a set, known as the global attractor; for many problems this set is finite dimensional, even if the state space is infinite dimensional. For Markovian systems, the statistical properties of long-term trajectories are uniquely determined by the solution operator that maps the evolution of the system over arbitrary positive time increments. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework to learn the underlying solution operator for dissipative chaotic systems, showing that the resulting learned operator accurately captures short-time trajectories and long-time statistical behavior. Using this framework, we are able to predict various statistics of the invariant measure for the turbulent Kolmogorov Flow dynamics with Reynolds numbers up to 5000.},

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for sensitivity analysis of discrete chaos with an arbitrary number of positive Lyapunov exponents. We combine the concept of perturbation space-splitting, which regularizes Ruelle’s original expression, with measure-based parameterization of the expanding subspace. We use these tools to rigorously derive trajectory-following recursive relations that converge exponentially fast and construct a memory-efficient Monte Carlo scheme for derivatives of the output statistics. Thanks to the regularization and lack of simplifying assumptions on the system’s behavior, our method is immune to the common problems of other popular methods such as the exploding tangent solutions and unphysical shadowing directions.

  abstract = {The climate system is a complex, chaotic system with many degrees of freedom and variability on a vast range of temporal and spatial scales. Attaining a deeper level of understanding of its dynamical processes is a scientific challenge of great urgency, especially given the ongoing climate change and the evolving climate crisis. In statistical physics, complex, many-particle systems are studied successfully using the mathematical framework of Large Deviation Theory (LDT). A great potential exists for applying LDT to problems relevant for geophysical fluid dynamics and climate science. In particular, LDT allows for understanding the fundamental properties of persistent deviations of climatic fields from the long-term averages and for associating them to low-frequency, large scale patterns of climatic variability. Additionally, LDT can be used in conjunction with so-called rare events algorithms to explore rarely visited regions of the phase space and thus to study special dynamical configurations of the climate. These applications are of key importance to improve our understanding of high-impact weather and climate events. Furthermore, LDT provides powerful tools for evaluating the probability of noise-induced transitions between competing metastable states of the climate system or of its components. This in turn essential for improving our understanding of the global stability properties of the climate system and of its predictability of the second kind in the sense of Lorenz. The goal of this review is manifold. First, we want to provide an introduction to the derivation of large deviation laws in the context of stochastic processes. We then relate such results to the existing literature showing the current status of applications of LDT in climate science and geophysical fluid dynamics. Finally, we propose some possible lines of future investigations.},

  abstract = {It is shown that by a small C 2 (resp. C 00) perturbation of a quasi-periodic flow on the 3-torus (resp. the m-torus, m>3), one can produce strange Axiom A attractors. Ancillary results and physical interpretation are also discussed. 1. Statement of Results The main purpose of this note is to prove the following fact. Theorem 1. Let a = (a 1 ,... ,a n) be a constant vector field on the torus T n = W/TL n. If n-3, in every C 2 neighborhood of a there is a vector field satisfying Axiom A and having a non trivial attractor. If n §:4, in every C 00 neighborhood of a there is a vector field satisfying Axiom A and having a non trivial attractor. We say that an Axiom A attractor is non trivial (or "strange") if it does not consist of a single periodic orbit (for general definitions, see Smale [7]). The above theorem improves a result of Ruelle and Takens [6], and can be obtained by simple modifications of the proof given there. We nevertheless give here a complete proof, based on the following result which is of interest in itself. Theorem 2. Let M be a C 00 compact manifold of dimension m. (a) // m-2, in every C 1 neighborhood of the identity there is an Axiom A diffeomorphism with a non trivial attractor. (b) If M = T 2 , in every C 2 neighborhood of the identity there is an Axiom A diffeomorphism with a non trivial attractor. (c) // m^3, in every C°° neighborhood of the identity there is an Axiom A diffeomorphism with a non trivial attractor. The proof of these theorems is given in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3 we discuss non trivial attractors for Axiom A diffeomorphisms of two-dimensional manifolds. Section 4 is devoted to physical interpretation of Theorem 1.},

The first part is a general overview, mostly in chronological order. The four remaining sections contain more detailed expositions of some key topics. Modeling the weather Lorenz, a meteorologist at MIT, was interested in the foundations of long-range weather forecasting. With the advent of computers, it had become popular to try to predict the weather by numerical analysis of equations governing the atmosphere's evolution. The results were, nevertheless, rather poor. A statistical approach looked promising, but Lorenz was convinced that statistical methods in use at the time, especially prediction by linear regression, were essentially flawed because the evolution equations are very far from being linear. To test his ideas, he decided to compare different methods applied to a simplified non-linear model for the weather. The size of the model (number and complexity of the equations) was a critical issue because of the limited computing power available in those days. 1 After experimenting with several examples, Lorenz learned from B.

It has recently been shown that machine learning methods can improve the solution accuracy by correcting for effects not captured by the discretized PDE. We target the problem of reducing numerical errors of iterative PDE solvers and compare different learning approaches for finding complex correction functions. We find that previously used learning approaches are significantly outperformed by methods that integrate the solver into the training loop and thereby allow the model to interact with the PDE during training. This provides the model with realistic input distributions that take previous corrections into account, yielding improvements in accuracy with stable rollouts of several hundred recurrent evaluation steps and surpassing even tailored supervised variants. We highlight the performance of the differentiable physics networks for a wide variety of PDEs, from non-linear advection-diffusion systems to three-dimensional Navier-Stokes flows.},

The highly influential chaotic hypothesis of Gallavotti and Cohen states that the large-scale dynamics of high-dimensional systems are effectively uniformly hyperbolic, which implies many felicitous statistical properties. We obtain direct and reliable numerical evidence, contrary to the chaotic hypothesis, of the existence of non-hyperbolic large-scale dynamical structures in a mean-field coupled system. To do this, we reduce the system to its thermodynamic limit, which we approximate numerically with a Chebyshev basis transfer operator discretization. This enables us to obtain a high-precision estimate of a homoclinic tangency, implying a failure of uniform hyperbolicity. Robust non-hyperbolic behaviour is expected under perturbation. As a result, the chaotic hypothesis should not be <italic>a priori</italic> assumed to hold in all systems, and a better understanding of the domain of its validity is required. </p>},

Although important in applications, this differentiability, which is thought to be connected to the dimensionality of the system, has remained resistant to rigorous study. To model non-uniformly hyperbolic systems, we consider a family of the mathematically tractable class of piecewise smooth hyperbolic maps, the Lozi maps. For these maps we prove that the existence of a formal derivative of the response reduces to an exponential mixing property of the SRB measure when conditioned on the map's singularity set. This property appears to be true and is of independent interest. Further study of this conditional mixing property may yield a better picture of linear response theory.},

  abstract = {C ertain generating functions-encoding properties of objects like prime numbers , periodic orbits, …-have received the name of zeta functions. They are useful in studying the statistical properties of the objects in question. Zeta functions have generally been associated with problems of arithmetic or algebra and tend to have common features: meromorphy, Euler product formula, functional equation, location of poles and zeros (Dirichlet series expansion, Riemann hypothesis), and relation with certain operators (typically operators acting on cohomology groups). The dynamical zeta functions to be discussed here are set up to count periodic orbits but to count them with fairly general weights. As a consequence the subject will have a more function-theoretic flavor than the study of arithmetic or algebraic zeta functions. Apart from that, our zeta functions will have properties similar to those of the more traditional ones. The main difference will be that the relevant operators (called transfer operators) will act on (infinite-dimensional) cochain groups instead of (finite-dimensional) cohomology groups. Intuitively, the weights that we have introduced prevent passage from cochains to cohomology groups. Technically this will force us to consider determinants in infinite dimension. The study of dynam-ical zeta functions uses original tools (transfer operators, kneading determinants), which we shall discuss below. The simplest invariant measures for a dynamical system are those carried by periodic orbits. Counting periodic orbits is thus a natural task from the point of view of ergodic theory. And dynamical zeta functions are an effective tool to do the counting. The tool turns out to be so effective in fact as to make one suspect that there is more to the story than what we currently understand. The grandmother of all zeta functions is the Riemann zeta function defined by ζ R (s) = ∞ n=1 n −s for Re s > 1. Actually, this function was first considered by Euler, who noted that ζ R (s) = p prime (1 − p −s) −1 (this is the Euler product formula). Riemann showed that ζ R (s) extends meromorphically to C with a single pole at s = 1 and that there is a functional equation relating ζ R (s) and ζ R (1 − s). Because ζ R is a generating function for the primes, it can be used to prove the prime number theorem: that the number of primes up to x is ∼ x/ log x. A theorem from harmonic analysis called the Wiener-Ikehara Tauberian theorem yields the prime number theorem from the fact that ζ R (s) has a simple pole at s = 1 and no other pole or zero for Re s ≥ 1. After the Riemann zeta function, innumerable functions with related properties have been introduced. In particular, given an algebraic variety over a finite field F q , we may define a "Weil zeta func-tion" by ζ W (z) = exp ∞ m=1 z m m |Fixf m |. Here one has extended the algebraic variety to the algebraic closure of F q , obtaining a space M, and f : M → M is the Frobenius map (acting by z → z q on coordinates); |Fix f m | is the number of fixed points of the m-th iterate of f. The function ζ W (z)},

The situation of interest is when only minimal parametric information is available on the form of the true model. Under this setting, we post optimization programs that compute the worst-case performance measures, subject to constraints on the amount of model misspecification measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our main contribution is the development of infinitesimal approximations for these programs, resulting in asymptotic expansions of their optimal values as the divergence shrinks to zero. The coefficients of these expansions can be computed via simulation, and are mathematically derived from the representation of the worst-case models as changes of measure that satisfy a well-defined class of functional fixed-point equations.},

In this method, a reduced basis is constructed from a set of full-order snapshots by the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the Gaussian process regression (GPR) is used to approximate the projection coefficients. The GPR is carried out in the offline stage with active data selection, and the outputs for new parameter values can be obtained rapidly as probabilistic distributions during the online stage. Due to the complete decoupling of the offline and online stages, the proposed non-intrusive RB method provides a powerful tool to efficiently solve parametrized nonlinear problems with various engineering applications requiring multi-query or real-time evaluations. With both geometric and material nonlinearities taken into account, numerical results are presented for typical 1D and 3D examples, illustrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

By using an approach based on Lyapunov functions, we provide estimates for geometrically ergodic Markov chains under weak assumptions. In an autoregressive model, our bounds cannot be improved in general.

  abstract = {<p>The Earth’s climate system is a classical example of a multiscale, multiphysics dynamical system with an extremely large number of active degrees of freedom, exhibiting variability on scales ranging from micrometers and seconds in cloud microphysics, to thousands of kilometers and centuries in ocean dynamics. Yet, despite this dynamical complexity, climate dynamics is known to exhibit coherent modes of variability. A primary example is the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the dominant mode of interannual (3–5 yr) variability in the climate system. The objective and robust characterization of this and other important phenomena presents a long-standing challenge in Earth system science, the resolution of which would lead to improved scientific understanding and prediction of climate dynamics, as well as assessment of their impacts on human and natural systems. Here, we show that the spectral theory of dynamical systems, combined with techniques from data science, provides an effective means for extracting coherent modes of climate variability from high-dimensional model and observational data, requiring no frequency prefiltering, but recovering multiple timescales and their interactions. Lifecycle composites of ENSO are shown to improve upon results from conventional indices in terms of dynamical consistency and physical interpretability. In addition, the role of combination modes between ENSO and the annual cycle in ENSO diversity is elucidated.</p>},

We consider the full nonlinear dynamics without approximation, producing rigorous bounds on the expected future value of a quantity of interest even when only limited statistics of the initial condition (e.g., mean and variance) are known. For dynamical systems evolving in compact sets, the best upper (lower) bound coincides with the largest (smallest) expectation among all initial state distributions consistent with the known statistics. For systems governed by polynomial equations and polynomial quantities of interest, one-sided estimates on the optimal bounds can be computed using tools from polynomial optimization and semidefinite programming.

We generalize the likelihood ratio approach and formulate the linear response as a product of two martingales, hence the name ‘martingale product estimators’. We present a systematic derivation of the martingale product estimator, and show how to construct such estimator so that its bias is consistent with the weak order of the numerical scheme that approximates the underlying stochastic differential equation. Motivated by the estimation of transport properties in molecular systems, we present a rigorous numerical analysis of the bias and variance for these new estimators in the case of Langevin dynamics. We prove that the variance is uniformly bounded in time and derive a specific form of the estimator for second-order splitting schemes for Langevin dynamics. For comparison, we also study the bias and variance of a Green–Kubo (GK) estimator, motivated, in part, by its variance growing linearly in time. We compare on illustrative numerical tests the new estimators with results obtained by the GK method.</p>},

  abstract = {<p>Consider a computer system having a CPU that feeds jobs to two input/output (I/O) devices having different speeds. Let θ be the fraction of jobs routed to the first I/O device, so that 1 - θ is the fraction routed to the second. Suppose that α = α(θ) is the steady-sate amount of time that a job spends in the system. Given that θ is a decision variable, a designer might wish to minimize α(θ) over θ. Since α(·) is typically difficult to evaluate analytically, Monte Carlo optimization is an attractive methodology. By analogy with deterministic mathematical programming, efficient Monte Carlo gradient estimation is an important ingredient of simulation-based optimization algorithms. As a consequence, gradient estimation has recently attracted considerable attention in the simulation community. It is our goal, in this article, to describe one efficient method for estimating gradients in the Monte Carlo setting, namely the likelihood ratio method (also known as the efficient score method). This technique has been previously described (in less general settings than those developed in this article) in [6, 16, 18, 21]. An alternative gradient estimation procedure is infinitesimal perturbation analysis; see [11, 12] for an introduction. While it is typically more difficult to apply to a given application than the likelihood ratio technique of interest here, it often turns out to be statistically more accurate.</p>},
